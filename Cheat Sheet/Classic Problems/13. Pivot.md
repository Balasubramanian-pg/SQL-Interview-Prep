## Pattern 13: Pivot (Rows to Columns)

**Manual Pivot with CASE:**
```sql
SELECT 
    product_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Jan,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Feb,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) as Mar
FROM monthly_sales
GROUP BY product_id
```

**Using PIVOT (SQL Server):**
```sql
SELECT product_id, [Jan], [Feb], [Mar]
FROM monthly_sales
PIVOT (
    SUM(sales)
    FOR month IN ([Jan], [Feb], [Mar])
) as pvt
```
