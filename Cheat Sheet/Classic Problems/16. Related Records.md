## Pattern 16: ALL Related Records Meet Condition

**Students Who Passed ALL Exams:**
```sql
-- Using NOT EXISTS (check if any failed)
SELECT student_id, student_name
FROM students s
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM exam_results e 
    WHERE e.student_id = s.student_id 
    AND e.score < 60
)

-- Using GROUP BY + HAVING
SELECT student_id
FROM exam_results
GROUP BY student_id
HAVING MIN(score) >= 60  -- All scores must be >= 60
```

**Customers Who Bought ALL Product Categories:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM purchases
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT category) = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) FROM products
)
```
