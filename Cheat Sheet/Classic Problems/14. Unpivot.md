## Pattern 14: Unpivot (Columns to Rows)

**Manual Unpivot with UNION ALL:**
```sql
SELECT product_id, 'Jan' as month, Jan as sales FROM sales_table
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'Feb' as month, Feb as sales FROM sales_table
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'Mar' as month, Mar as sales FROM sales_table
```
