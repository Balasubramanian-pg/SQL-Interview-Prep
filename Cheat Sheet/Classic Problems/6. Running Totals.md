## Pattern 6: Running Totals & Cumulative Sums

**Basic Running Total:**
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER(ORDER BY order_date) as running_total
FROM orders
```

**Running Total Per Group:**
```sql
SELECT 
    dept_id,
    expense_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER(PARTITION BY dept_id ORDER BY expense_date) as dept_running_total
FROM expenses
```

**Running Total with Frame (explicit):**
```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER(
        ORDER BY order_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as running_total
FROM orders
```

**Interview Trap:** Without `ROWS BETWEEN`, behavior can be unexpected with duplicate ORDER BY values!
