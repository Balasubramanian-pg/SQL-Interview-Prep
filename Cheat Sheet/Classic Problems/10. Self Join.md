## Pattern 10: Self-Join (Employee-Manager)

**Get Employee with Manager Name:**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_name,
    e.salary,
    m.employee_name as manager_name,
    m.salary as manager_salary
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
```

**Find Employees Earning More Than Manager:**
```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_name,
    e.salary,
    m.employee_name as manager_name,
    m.salary as manager_salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
WHERE e.salary > m.salary
```
