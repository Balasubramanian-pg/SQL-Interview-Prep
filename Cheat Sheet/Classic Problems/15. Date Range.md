## Pattern 15: Date Range Overlaps

**Find Overlapping Reservations:**
```sql
-- Two ranges overlap if: start1 <= end2 AND end1 >= start2
SELECT 
    r1.room_id,
    r1.guest_name as guest1,
    r2.guest_name as guest2,
    r1.check_in as check_in1,
    r2.check_in as check_in2
FROM reservations r1
INNER JOIN reservations r2 
    ON r1.room_id = r2.room_id
    AND r1.reservation_id < r2.reservation_id  -- Avoid duplicate pairs
    AND r1.check_in <= r2.check_out
    AND r1.check_out >= r2.check_in
```
