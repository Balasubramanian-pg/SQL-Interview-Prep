## Pattern 1: Finding Duplicates

**Basic Duplicates (show duplicate values):**
```sql
-- Find emails that appear more than once
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM users
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

**Show All Duplicate Rows (including details):**
```sql
-- Method 1: Subquery
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE email IN (
    SELECT email
    FROM users
    GROUP BY email
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)

-- Method 2: Window function (better performance)
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY email) as cnt
    FROM users
) sub
WHERE cnt > 1
```

**Find Duplicates Based on Multiple Columns:**
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, COUNT(*) as dup_count
FROM users
GROUP BY first_name, last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
