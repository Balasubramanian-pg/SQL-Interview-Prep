## Pattern 12: Anti-Join (Records with No Match)

**Customers Who Never Ordered:**
```sql
-- Method 1: LEFT JOIN + IS NULL
SELECT c.*
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL

-- Method 2: NOT EXISTS (often faster)
SELECT *
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
)

-- Method 3: NOT IN (dangerous with NULLs!)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
)
```
