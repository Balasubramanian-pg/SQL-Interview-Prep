## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 10: Least Privilege Always

Power without restraint is a liability.
In data systems, excess privilege turns mistakes into incidents.

Security is not about trust. It is about containment.

### The Principle

**SQL must assume minimal permissions.**

Every user, role, and service should have exactly the access required to perform its function. Nothing more.

### Separate Read and Write Roles

Reading data and modifying data are fundamentally different responsibilities.

* Read-only roles for analytics and reporting
* Write roles restricted to controlled pipelines
* Administrative roles used sparingly and temporarily

If a role can write when it only needs to read, failure becomes destructive instead of recoverable.

### No Direct Table Access When Views Suffice

Tables are implementation details. Views are interfaces.

* Expose curated views to consumers
* Hide raw tables behind controlled abstractions
* Centralize logic and filtering

Direct table access bypasses governance, security, and intent. Views enforce contracts.

### Never Embed Credentials or Secrets

Secrets do not belong in SQL.

* No hard-coded passwords
* No API keys in scripts
* No tokens in stored procedures

Credentials must live in secure stores with rotation and auditability. Anything else is a breach waiting to happen.

### Why Least Privilege Matters

Most data incidents are not malicious. They are accidental.

* Wrong query in the wrong environment
* Debug script run in production
* Misconfigured job with elevated access

Least privilege limits blast radius. It turns catastrophic mistakes into contained errors.

### Design Standard

Access must be:

* Explicitly granted
* Regularly reviewed
* Easy to revoke
* Difficult to misuse

If revoking access breaks workflows unexpectedly, access was too broad.

### Code Review Test

Before approving SQL or access changes, ask:

* What is the minimum access required?
* What damage could this role cause?
* How easily can this access be revoked?

If the answer is unclear, the privilege is too high.

### Closing Statement

Security is not about stopping attackers.
It is about surviving mistakes.

Least privilege makes failure survivable.

Say **next** when you are ready to continue.
