## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 7: Predictable Performance Beats Fast Queries

Speed is impressive.
Stability is dependable.

In enterprise systems, performance that fluctuates is worse than performance that is merely slower. A query that sometimes finishes in 50 ms and sometimes takes 30 seconds is not fast. It is unreliable.

### The Principle

**Predictability is a performance feature.**

A stable 500 ms query is superior to a volatile 50 ms query because systems are built on expectations, not best cases.

### Why Predictability Matters

Enterprise systems are not evaluated in isolation.

* Dashboards refresh on schedules
* Pipelines chain multiple queries
* SLAs depend on worst-case execution
* Users notice inconsistency more than slowness

Unpredictable performance breaks trust, even when averages look good.

### Avoid Data-Dependent Execution Paths

Queries must not change behavior drastically based on data shape.

* Logic should not branch based on row counts
* Performance must not hinge on rare values
* Execution plans should not collapse under skew

When performance depends on the data distribution of the day, outages become calendar events.

### Avoid Correlated Subqueries at Scale

Correlated subqueries often look elegant and perform acceptably on small datasets.

At scale, they:

* Multiply work invisibly
* Execute once per row
* Collapse under growth

What appears linear becomes exponential. Predictability disappears long before failure is obvious.

### Avoid Hidden Cartesian Explosions

Cartesian growth is silent until it is catastrophic.

* Missing join conditions
* Incorrect join keys
* Assumed uniqueness that does not exist

These failures rarely show up in development. They surface when data grows or distributions change, precisely when the system is under real load.

### Why “Fast Enough Today” Is a Trap

Queries optimized for today’s volume encode assumptions about the future.

* Small tables become large
* Sparse keys become dense
* Optional joins become mandatory

When performance collapses after growth, the root cause is almost always early optimism.

### Design Standard

A performance-safe query:

* Has a predictable execution plan
* Scales linearly with data volume
* Degrades gradually, not suddenly
* Behaves similarly across environments

If performance changes dramatically with small data shifts, the design is unstable.

### Code Review Test

Before approving a query, ask:

* How does this behave at 10x data?
* What is the worst-case execution path?
* Which assumption would break first?

If the answer is unknown, the query is not production-ready.

### Closing Statement

Fast queries impress in demos.
Predictable queries survive in production.

Enterprise systems are built on guarantees, not optimism.
