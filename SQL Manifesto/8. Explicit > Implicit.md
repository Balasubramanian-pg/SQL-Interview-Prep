## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 8: Explicit Is Faster Than Implicit

Implicit behavior feels convenient until it changes.
Explicit behavior survives upgrades.

Databases evolve. Optimizers change. Defaults shift. What remains stable is only what you declare with intent.

### The Principle

**Never rely on engine defaults.**

If behavior matters, it must be written down in SQL. Anything left implicit is a dependency you do not control.

### Explicit Joins

Join intent must be visible.

* Always use explicit `JOIN` syntax
* Always specify join conditions
* Never rely on accidental column name matches

Implicit joins hide cardinality, obscure logic, and make Cartesian explosions easier to introduce and harder to detect.

Clarity is not verbosity. It is precision.

### Explicit Casts

Types are rules, not suggestions.

* Cast when crossing type boundaries
* Align join keys intentionally
* Never assume implicit conversion is stable

Implicit casting can:

* Disable indexes
* Change execution plans
* Produce different results across engines

A cast is a statement of intent. Without it, the engine decides for you.

### Explicit Filters

Filtering is business logic.

* State filtering conditions clearly
* Avoid relying on WHERE clause side effects
* Do not depend on join order for filtering

Implicit filtering through joins or assumptions creates fragile logic that breaks under optimization.

### Why Explicitness Improves Performance

Explicit SQL:

* Gives the optimizer clearer intent
* Reduces ambiguity in execution plans
* Prevents silent plan regressions
* Makes performance reproducible

The optimizer can only optimize what it understands. Ambiguity limits optimization.

### Why Implicit Behavior Is Dangerous

Implicit behavior:

* Varies by database vendor
* Changes across versions
* Differs between environments
* Breaks during migrations

What worked yesterday may slow down tomorrow without a single line of code changing.

### Design Standard

Every critical behavior must be visible in SQL:

* How tables are joined
* How types are aligned
* How rows are filtered
* How nulls are handled

If a reader must know engine-specific defaults to understand the query, the query is incomplete.

### Code Review Test

Before approving SQL, ask:

* Would this behave the same on a different engine?
* Would this survive a version upgrade?
* Is intent obvious without documentation?

If the answer is no, make it explicit.

### Closing Statement

Implicit behavior is borrowed performance.
Explicit behavior is owned performance.

Own your intent.

Say **next** when you are ready to continue.
