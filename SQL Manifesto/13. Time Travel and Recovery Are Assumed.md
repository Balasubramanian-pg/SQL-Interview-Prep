## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 13: Time Travel and Recovery Are Assumed

Data systems must remember their past.
If history can be destroyed, trust will eventually follow.

Production data is not static. Corrections happen. Logic evolves. Facts are reinterpreted. Systems that cannot revisit yesterday are condemned to guesswork.

### The Principle

**SQL design must assume recovery, replay, and correction are routine.**

If the system cannot safely revisit history, it is not production-ready.

### Backfills Are Normal, Not Exceptional

Backfills are not emergencies. They are a standard operation.

* Late-arriving data
* Logic fixes
* Corrected source feeds
* Recomputed metrics

A system that treats backfills as special cases will eventually block them or corrupt data when they occur.

### Replays Must Be Safe

Reprocessing is inevitable.

* Pipelines are rerun
* Snapshots are rebuilt
* Historical ranges are recalculated

Replay must not:

* Duplicate data
* Change unrelated records
* Break downstream assumptions

If replay requires custom one-off scripts, the system is already fragile.

### Historical Correction Must Be Possible

Reality changes. So must data.

* Business rules are clarified
* Source systems fix errors
* Definitions evolve

The system must allow corrections without erasing history or rewriting the past silently. Truth includes knowing what was true at the time.

### Destructive Updates Are Forbidden Without Recovery Paths

Blind overwrites destroy evidence.

* `DELETE` without archival is erasure
* `UPDATE` without versioning loses context
* Truncation without snapshot is irreversible damage

If an operation cannot be undone, it must be questioned aggressively.

### Design Standard

A recoverable system:

* Preserves historical states or deltas
* Supports deterministic reprocessing
* Separates correction from erasure
* Makes history queryable

If data changes cannot be explained after the fact, the design is incomplete.

### Code Review Test

Before approving destructive logic, ask:

* Can we reconstruct the previous state?
* Can we explain changes months later?
* Can we safely replay this logic?

If the answer is no, the operation is not allowed.

### Closing Statement

Production data is a record of truth over time.
Systems that forget their past cannot be trusted with the future.
