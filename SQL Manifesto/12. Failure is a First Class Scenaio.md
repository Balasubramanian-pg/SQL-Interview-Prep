## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 12: Failure Is a First-Class Scenario

Success is easy.
Failure is inevitable.

Enterprise systems must be designed with the assumption that things will go wrong, often and without warning. Failure is not an exception. It is a standard execution path.

### The Principle

**Every write operation must define its failure behavior.**

If failure handling is not designed, the system is incomplete.

### Define What Happens When It Fails

Every data-changing operation must answer:

* What state is the data left in?
* Is the failure atomic or partial?
* Is the system still consistent?

Failure without a defined outcome creates ambiguity, and ambiguity is corruption in slow motion.

### Define How It Rolls Back

Rollback is not an afterthought.

* Transactions must revert all changes
* Partial writes must not survive
* Cleanup must be automatic, not manual

If rollback requires human intervention, recovery will eventually fail under pressure.

### Define How It Is Retried Safely

Retries are guaranteed. Unsafe retries are optional disasters.

* Operations must be idempotent
* Re-execution must converge to the same state
* Intermediate failures must not compound damage

If a retry makes things worse, the system is fragile.

### Why Ignoring Failure Creates Debt

Unhandled failure produces:

* Inconsistent states
* Orphaned records
* Broken aggregates
* Emergency scripts
* Institutional knowledge loss

These problems do not disappear. They accumulate.

### Design Standard

A write operation is production-ready only if:

* Failure leaves the system consistent
* Rollback is automatic and complete
* Retrying is safe and predictable
* No manual cleanup is required

If any of these are missing, the operation is not done.

### Code Review Test

Before approving a write path, ask:

* What happens if this fails halfway?
* What happens if it runs again?
* What happens if it fails under load?

If failure behavior is undefined, the design is unfinished.

### Closing Statement

Success proves nothing.
Failure reveals design.

Treat failure as a first-class scenario, or it will treat you as an afterthought.

Say **next** when you are ready to continue.
