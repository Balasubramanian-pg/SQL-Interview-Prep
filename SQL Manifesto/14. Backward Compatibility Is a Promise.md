## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 14: Backward Compatibility Is a Promise

Production data is consumed by systems you cannot see.
Breaking them silently is not evolution. It is negligence.

Once SQL is in production, it becomes a dependency. That dependency must be honored.

### The Principle

**Production SQL must not break existing consumers.**

Compatibility is not politeness. It is a contractual obligation.

### Additive Changes Are Preferred

Growth should extend, not replace.

* Add new columns instead of modifying old ones
* Add new views instead of rewriting existing ones
* Extend logic without altering established behavior

Additive change preserves trust and reduces coordination overhead.

### Deprecation Before Removal

Removal without warning is a failure of stewardship.

* Mark fields as deprecated
* Communicate timelines clearly
* Provide migration paths
* Allow overlap periods

Deprecation is how systems evolve without disruption.

### Versioned Views When Necessary

When logic must change meaningfully, version it.

* `view_v1`, `view_v2`
* Parallel support windows
* Explicit opt-in to new behavior

Versioning isolates change and gives consumers control over adoption.

### Why This Rule Exists

Consumers do not update in lockstep.

* Dashboards refresh on different cycles
* Downstream systems lag
* External partners move slowly

Backward compatibility absorbs this reality.

### Design Standard

A change is acceptable only if:

* Existing consumers continue to function, or
* A versioned alternative is provided, or
* All consumers are migrated intentionally

Anything else is a breaking change and must be treated as such.

### Code Review Test

Before approving changes, ask:

* Who consumes this?
* Will their results change?
* Do they have a migration path?

If the answers are unknown, the change is unsafe.

### Closing Statement

Backward compatibility is not about avoiding change.
It is about respecting dependency.

Breaking trust is easy. Keeping it requires discipline.

Say **next** when you are ready to continue.
