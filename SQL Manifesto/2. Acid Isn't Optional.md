## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 2: ACID Is Not Optional

ACID is not academic theory. It is the minimum bar for systems that claim to be reliable. The moment data is written, the system makes a promise. ACID defines whether that promise is real or ceremonial.

If any letter is weakened, the system is not “mostly correct”. It is structurally dishonest.

### The Principle

Every write path must preserve **all four ACID guarantees**:

* Atomicity
* Consistency
* Isolation
* Durability

These guarantees are inseparable. Treating them as trade-offs turns correctness into a gamble.

### Atomicity: All or Nothing

Atomicity means a write either completes fully or does not exist at all.

* No partial inserts
* No half-applied updates
* No silent truncation of intent

A transaction that leaves the system in an intermediate state is a failure, even if no error is thrown.

Atomicity ensures that business events are indivisible. A sale, a payment, a status change. These are not sequences. They are facts.

### Consistency: Rules Are Law

Consistency means the data always respects business logic.

* Constraints are enforced
* Relationships remain valid
* Aggregates reconcile
* Invariants never break

Consistency is not limited to foreign keys and checks. It includes domain rules that live in code, models, and expectations.

If the system allows invalid states, it is not flexible. It is unsafe.

### Isolation: No Shared Hallucinations

Isolation ensures concurrent operations do not corrupt each other’s reality.

* One session cannot see another session’s uncommitted work
* Parallel writes do not overwrite intent
* Reads do not depend on timing accidents

Isolation prevents race conditions from becoming data corruption. Without it, correctness depends on luck and load.

Concurrency is inevitable. Isolation is how you survive it.

### Durability: Memory Must Outlive Failure

Durability means once a transaction is committed, it stays committed.

* Crashes do not erase truth
* Power loss does not rewind history
* Restarts do not question completed work

If committed data can disappear, the system is not a database. It is a cache with aspirations.

Durability is the final seal of trust.

### The Enterprise Threshold

A system that compromises even one ACID property may still function. It may even scale. It may even look impressive in demos.

It is still not enterprise-ready.

Enterprise systems are judged not by their best days, but by their worst failures.

### Common Rationalizations to Reject

* “Eventual consistency is good enough”
* “This workload is low risk”
* “We will reconcile later”
* “The tool handles it internally”

These are not architectural decisions. They are deferred incidents.

### Design Standard

Every write path must be designed so that:

* Failure is safe
* Recovery is predictable
* Reprocessing is possible
* Data never enters an invalid state

If achieving this is difficult, that is a signal to redesign, not to compromise.

### Closing Statement

ACID is not a feature you enable.
It is a discipline you enforce.

If any letter is optional, trust is optional.
