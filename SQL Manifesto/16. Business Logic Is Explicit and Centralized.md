## Data Engineering Manifesto

### Rule 16: Business Logic Is Explicit and Centralized

Distributed truth is not flexibility.
It is inconsistency waiting to surface.

When business logic is scattered, the system stops having a single source of truth. Every copy drifts. Every drift becomes a dispute.

### The Principle

**Business logic must be explicit and centralized.**

If a rule matters, it must exist in one authoritative place.

### One Definition of Metrics

Metrics are contracts.

* Revenue has one definition
* Active users has one definition
* Conversion rate has one definition

Multiple definitions guarantee conflicting numbers, broken trust, and endless reconciliation meetings.

Metrics must be defined once and reused everywhere.

### One Definition of Hierarchies

Hierarchies shape aggregation and visibility.

* Geographic rollups
* Organizational structures
* Product categorizations

If hierarchies are duplicated across queries, they will diverge. Divergence turns aggregation into fiction.

### One Definition of Security Rules

Security logic cannot be interpreted.

* Row visibility rules
* Column masking rules
* Role-based access

Multiple implementations of security are multiple vulnerabilities. Centralization is enforcement.

### Why Scattering Logic Fails

Scattered logic:

* Evolves independently
* Breaks silently
* Is impossible to audit
* Requires tribal knowledge

Centralized logic is visible, testable, and governable.

### Design Standard

Logic must live in:

* Canonical views
* Shared models
* Reusable functions
* Governed layers

If logic is copied into multiple queries, it is already wrong.

### Code Review Test

Before approving SQL, ask:

* Where is the authoritative definition?
* Is this logic reused or reimplemented?
* What happens when the rule changes?

If the answer involves “update all the queries”, the design has failed.

### Closing Statement

Business logic defines truth.
Truth must be singular.

Centralize logic, or prepare to reconcile forever.

Say **next** when you are ready to continue.
