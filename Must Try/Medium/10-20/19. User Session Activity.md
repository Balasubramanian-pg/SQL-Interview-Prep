# Top Engaged Users by Session Type

## 1. The Business Question
The objective of this query is to identify the most engaged users for different types of activities on the platform. The specific business question is:

**"For each session type (e.g., 'tweeter', 'viewer'), who were the most engaged users in terms of total time spent during the month of January 2022? Provide a ranked list of users for each session type, from most time spent to least."**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ranking must be performed independently for each `session_type`. The top 'tweeter' should be ranked #1 within the 'tweeter' group, and the top 'viewer' should be ranked #1 within the 'viewer' group.

## 2. Assumed Table Schema
The query references a single table, `sessions`. A plausible schema for this table would be:

```sql
-- Table: sessions
-- Stores a record for each user session on the platform.
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id    BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id       INT NOT NULL,
    session_type  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    start_date    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_date      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    duration      INT NOT NULL -- The duration of the session in seconds or minutes
);
```

> [!TIP]
> To optimize this query, a composite index covering the columns in the `WHERE` and `GROUP BY` clauses would be very effective.
>
> `CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_date_user_type ON sessions (start_date, user_id, session_type);`

## 3. Solution Approaches

### 3.1. Method 1: CTE for Aggregation, then Ranking (Recommended)
This approach is highly readable because it breaks the problem into two clear, logical steps: first, aggregate the data, and second, rank the aggregated results.

```sql
-- Step 1: Aggregate the total session duration for each user and session type.
WITH user_engagement AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        session_type,
        SUM(duration) AS total_duration
    FROM
        sessions
    WHERE
        start_date >= '2022-01-01' AND start_date < '2022-02-01'
    GROUP BY
        user_id,
        session_type
)
-- Step 2: Rank the users within each session type based on their total aggregated duration.
SELECT
    user_id,
    session_type,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY session_type
        ORDER BY total_duration DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    user_engagement;
```
#### 3.1.1. Explanation

1.  **The `user_engagement` CTE**:
    -   This Common Table Expression first calculates the total engagement for each user within each session type.
    -   `WHERE start_date >= '2022-01-01' AND start_date < '2022-02-01'`: This filters for sessions in January 2022. This format is often preferred over `BETWEEN` for timestamp data to avoid ambiguity with the end date's time component.
    -   `GROUP BY user_id, session_type`: This creates a summary group for each unique combination of a user and their session type.
    -   `SUM(duration)`: This calculates the total time spent for each of these groups.

2.  **The Final `SELECT` Statement**:
    -   This query operates on the pre-aggregated data from the CTE.
    -   `DENSE_RANK() OVER (...)`: This is the window function that performs the ranking.
        -   `PARTITION BY session_type`: This is a crucial instruction. It tells the ranking function to work on separate partitions of data. All 'tweeter' sessions are ranked against each other, and all 'viewer' sessions are ranked against each other. The rank resets for each new `session_type`.
        -   `ORDER BY total_duration DESC`: Within each partition, users are sorted by their `total_duration` in descending order, so the most engaged user gets rank #1.
        -   `DENSE_RANK()`: This function is a good choice as it handles ties by giving the same rank to users with the same duration and does not create gaps in the rank sequence.

> [!NOTE]
> The CTE approach is often favored for its exceptional readability. It clearly separates the process into "Step 1: Aggregate" and "Step 2: Rank," which is easier to debug and maintain.

### 3.2. Method 2: Combined Aggregation and Window Function
This method is more compact and can achieve the same result without an explicit CTE.

> [!CAUTION]
> This method is powerful but can be less intuitive for beginners, as it combines an aggregate function (`SUM`) inside the `ORDER BY` clause of a window function.

```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    session_type,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY session_type
        ORDER BY SUM(duration) DESC
    ) AS ranking
FROM
    sessions
WHERE
    start_date >= '2022-01-01' AND start_date < '2022-02-01'
GROUP BY
    user_id,
    session_type;
```

#### 3.2.1. Explanation

1.  **`FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ...`**: The query first filters the data by date and then groups it by `user_id` and `session_type`, just like in the CTE method.

2.  **`DENSE_RANK() OVER (...)`**: The window function is placed directly in the main `SELECT` clause.
    -   **`ORDER BY SUM(duration) DESC`**: This is the key difference. Instead of ordering by a pre-calculated column, the `ORDER BY` clause inside the `OVER()` block uses the aggregate function `SUM(duration)` directly.
    -   The database engine understands that it should first perform the `GROUP BY` aggregation (calculating `SUM(duration)` for each group) and then use those aggregated values to perform the ranking.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ability to use an aggregate function inside the `ORDER BY` clause of a window function is a powerful feature of modern SQL that allows for more concise queries.

## 4. Comparison of Methods
-   **Method 1 (CTE)**: Superior for readability and maintainability. The logical steps are explicit and easy to follow.
-   **Method 2 (Combined)**: More concise. Performance is often very similar to the CTE method, as modern database optimizers can handle both patterns efficiently. The choice is often a matter of coding style and clarity.
