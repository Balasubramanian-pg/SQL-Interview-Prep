This problem involves calculating the daily cancellation rate of trips, considering only unbanned users (both clients and drivers).

**1. Table Setup and Data**

**Tables:**

- `Trips`
    - `id`: Trip ID (INT)
    - `client_id`: Client User ID (INT)
    - `driver_id`: Driver User ID (INT)
    - `city_id`: City ID (INT)
    - `status`: Trip Status (VARCHAR) - e.g., 'completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client'
    - `request_at`: Trip Request Date (VARCHAR)
- `Users`
    - `users_id`: User ID (INT)
    - `banned`: User Banned Status (VARCHAR) - 'Yes' or 'No'
    - `role`: User Role (VARCHAR) - 'client' or 'driver'

**Sample Data (Provided):**

SQL

```SQL
- Trips Table Data
INSERT INTO Trips (id, client_id, driver_id, city_id, status, request_at) VALUES
('1', '1', '10', '1', 'completed', '2013-10-01'),
('2', '2', '11', '1', 'cancelled_by_driver', '2013-10-01'),
('3', '3', '12', '6', 'completed', '2013-10-01'),
('4', '4', '13', '6', 'cancelled_by_client', '2013-10-01'),
('5', '1', '10', '1', 'completed', '2013-10-02'),
('6', '2', '11', '6', 'completed', '2013-10-02'),
('7', '3', '12', '6', 'completed', '2013-10-02'),
('8', '2', '12', '12', 'completed', '2013-10-03'),
('9', '3', '10', '12', 'completed', '2013-10-03'),
('10', '4', '13', '12', 'cancelled_by_driver', '2013-10-03');
-- Users Table Data
INSERT INTO Users (users_id, banned, role) VALUES
('1', 'No', 'client'),
('2', 'Yes', 'client'),
('3', 'No', 'client'),
('4', 'No', 'client'),
('10', 'No', 'driver'),
('11', 'No', 'driver'),
('12', 'No', 'driver'),
('13', 'No', 'driver');
```

**2. Problem Definition**

Calculate the daily cancellation rate of trips, considering only trips where both the client and driver are not banned. The cancellation rate is defined as:

`Cancellation Rate = (Number of Cancelled Trips) / (Total Trips) * 100`

**3. Solution Breakdown**

**3.1. Joining Tables**

- We need to join the `Trips` table with the `Users` table twice: once for the client and once for the driver.
- This allows us to access the banned status of both the client and the driver for each trip.
- ```SQL
    FROM Trips t
    INNER JOIN Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id
    INNER JOIN Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id
    ```
    

**3.2. Filtering Banned Users**

- We must filter out trips where either the client or the driver is banned.
- ```SQL
    WHERE c.banned = 'No' AND d.banned = 'No'
    ```
    

**3.3. Grouping by Date**

- We need to calculate the cancellation rate for each day, so we group the results by `request_at`.
- ```SQL
    GROUP BY t.request_at
    ```
    

**3.4. Conditional Aggregation**

- We need to count the number of cancelled trips and the total number of trips for each day.
- ```SQL
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.status IN ('cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client') THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS cancelled_trip_count,
    COUNT(1) AS total_trips
    ```
    
    - `COUNT(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE NULL END)`: Counts only the rows where the `status` is 'cancelled_by_driver' or 'cancelled_by_client'.
    - `COUNT(1)`: Counts all rows in each group.

**3.5. Calculating Cancellation Rate**

- We divide the number of cancelled trips by the total number of trips and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
- We use `ROUND()` to format the result to two decimal places.
- `ROUND(1.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN t.status IN ('cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client') THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(1), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'`
    

**4. Complete SQL Query**

SQL

```SQL
SELECT
    t.request_at AS day,
    ROUND(1.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN t.status IN ('cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client') THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) / COUNT(1), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM
    Trips t
INNER JOIN
    Users c ON t.client_id = c.users_id
INNER JOIN
    Users d ON t.driver_id = d.users_id
WHERE
    c.banned = 'No' AND d.banned = 'No'
GROUP BY
    t.request_at;
```

**5. Key Concepts and Intuition**

- **Joins:** Combining data from multiple tables based on related columns.
- **Filtering:** Selecting rows that meet specific conditions.
- **Grouping:** Aggregating data into groups based on specified columns.
- **Conditional Aggregation:** Counting or summing values based on conditions.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Multiplying by `1.0` to ensure floating-point division.
- **Rounding:** Formatting the result to a specific number of decimal places.
- **Aliasing:** Using aliases to make the query more readable.

**6. Practical Applications**

- Analyzing service cancellation rates to identify trends and potential issues.
- Monitoring the impact of user bans on trip cancellations.
- Identifying days with unusually high cancellation rates for further investigation.

**7. Common Mistakes and Considerations**

- Forgetting to filter banned users correctly.
- Incorrectly joining the tables, leading to inaccurate results.
- Not handling potential division by zero errors (if there are days with no trips).
- Not rounding the result to the required decimal places.
- Not properly aliasing columns, making the query harder to read.
