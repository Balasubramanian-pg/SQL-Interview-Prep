Here's a comprehensive SQL solution to increment salaries for employees who have completed 2 years with the organization:

```SQL
-- Check which employees qualify for increment (2+ years of service)
SELECT
    id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    DepartmentName,
    Salary AS current_salary,
    HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS years_of_service,
    CASE
        WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 2
        THEN 'Eligible for 15% increment'
        ELSE 'Not eligible'
    END AS increment_status
FROM employe
ORDER BY years_of_service DESC;

-- Actual update query to give 15% increment to eligible employees
UPDATE employe
SET Salary = Salary * 1.15  -- 15% increment
WHERE DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 2;

-- Verify the updated salaries
SELECT
    id,
    firstname,
    lastname,
    DepartmentName,
    Salary AS updated_salary,
    HireDate,
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) AS years_of_service
FROM employe
WHERE DATEDIFF(YEAR, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 2
ORDER BY years_of_service DESC;
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Proper Date Calculation**:
    - Uses `GETDATE()` for current date instead of hardcoding '2020-12-31'
    - More accurate than just comparing years (accounts for month/day)
2. **Complete Solution**:
    - First query identifies eligible employees
    - Update query applies the 15% increment
    - Final query verifies the changes
3. **Better Date Diff Handling**:
    
    - For more precise calculation (accounting for exact hire anniversary):
    
    ```SQL
    WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, HireDate, GETDATE()) >= 730  -- 365 * 2
    ```
    
4. **Alternative for Precise Anniversary Calculation**:
    
    ```SQL
    WHERE DATEADD(YEAR, 2, HireDate) <= GETDATE()
    ```
    

This solution works in SQL Server (SSMS) as requested. For other databases:

- MySQL: Use `CURDATE()` instead of `GETDATE()`
- Oracle: Use `SYSDATE` and `MONTHS_BETWEEN` function
- PostgreSQL: Use `CURRENT_DATE`
