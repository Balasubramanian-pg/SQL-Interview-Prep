## Table Setup

```SQL
CREATE TABLE t3(id int);
CREATE TABLE t4(id int);

INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (1), (1), (2);  -- 3 rows (two 1s and one 2)
INSERT INTO t4 VALUES (1), (1), (1), (3);  -- 4 rows (three 1s and one 3)
```

## JOIN Results Analysis

### 1. INNER JOIN

```SQL
SELECT * FROM t3 INNER JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id;
```

**Result**: 6 rows

**Logic**:

- 2 rows in t3 with value 1 × 3 matching rows in t4 = 6 combinations
- Row with id=2 in t3 doesn't match anything in t4 (excluded)
- Row with id=3 in t4 doesn't match anything in t3 (excluded)

### 2. LEFT JOIN

```SQL
SELECT * FROM t3 LEFT JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id;
```

**Result**: 7 rows (6 matches + 1 unmatched from left)

**Breakdown**:

- 6 matching rows (same as INNER JOIN)
- Plus 1 row for id=2 in t3 (with NULLs for t4 columns)

### 3. RIGHT JOIN

```SQL
SELECT * FROM t3 RIGHT JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id;
```

**Result**: 7 rows (6 matches + 1 unmatched from right)

**Breakdown**:

- 6 matching rows (same as INNER JOIN)
- Plus 1 row for id=3 in t4 (with NULLs for t3 columns)

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

**SQL Server Syntax**:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM t3 FULL OUTER JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id;
```

**MySQL Equivalent**:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM t3 LEFT JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM t3 RIGHT JOIN t4 ON t3.id = t4.id;
```

**Result**: 8 rows

**Breakdown**:

- 6 matching rows (INNER JOIN result)
- 1 unmatched row from t3 (id=2)
- 1 unmatched row from t4 (id=3)

## Visual Representation

```Plain
Table t3:     Table t4:
+----+        +----+
| id |        | id |
+----+        +----+
| 1  |        | 1  |
| 1  |        | 1  |
| 2  |        | 1  |
+----+        | 3  |
              +----+

FULL OUTER JOIN Result:
+------+------+
| t3.id| t4.id|
+------+------+
| 1    | 1    | ← 6 matching combinations
| 1    | 1    |    (2×3)
| 1    | 1    |
| 1    | 1    |
| 1    | 1    |
| 1    | 1    |
| 2    | NULL | ← Unmatched from left
| NULL | 3    | ← Unmatched from right
+------+------+
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **INNER JOIN** only returns matching records (cartesian product of matches)
2. **LEFT JOIN** returns all matches plus unmatched records from left table
3. **RIGHT JOIN** returns all matches plus unmatched records from right table
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns all matches plus unmatched from both tables
5. **UNION** in MySQL simulates FULL OUTER JOIN by combining LEFT and RIGHT joins
6. With duplicates, matching records multiply (2×3=6 matches in this case)
7. NULL values appear for non-matching columns in OUTER JOINs
