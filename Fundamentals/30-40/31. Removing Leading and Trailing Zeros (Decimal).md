To remove unnecessary leading and trailing zeros from decimal values in SQL, you can use several approaches depending on your database system:

## Method 1: CAST to FLOAT (Standard SQL)

```SQL
SELECT
    sales AS original_value,
    CAST(sales AS FLOAT) AS cleaned_amount
FROM superstore_orders;
```

## Method 2: Using FORMAT or TO_CHAR (Database-Specific)

### SQL Server:

```SQL
SELECT
    sales AS original_value,
    FORMAT(sales, '0.########') AS cleaned_amount
FROM superstore_orders;
```

### Oracle/PostgreSQL:

```SQL
SELECT
    sales AS original_value,
    TO_CHAR(sales, '9999999990D9999999999') AS cleaned_amount
FROM superstore_orders;
```

### MySQL:

```SQL
SELECT
    sales AS original_value,
    TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM TRIM(TRAILING '0' FROM sales)) AS cleaned_amount
FROM superstore_orders;
```

## Method 3: Using Mathematical Operations

```SQL
SELECT
    sales AS original_value,
    CASE
        WHEN sales = FLOOR(sales) THEN CAST(FLOOR(sales) AS VARCHAR)
        ELSE RTRIM(RTRIM(REPLACE(CAST(sales AS VARCHAR), '0'), '.')
    END AS cleaned_amount
FROM superstore_orders;
```

## Important Considerations:

1. **Data Type Implications**:
    - CAST to FLOAT may affect precision for very large/small numbers
    - String-based methods maintain exact representation but return text
2. **Database Compatibility**:
    - The CAST approach works in most SQL dialects
    - Format functions vary by database vendor
3. **Performance**:
    - CAST operations are generally faster than string manipulations
    - For display purposes only, consider handling formatting in application code

## Example with Sample Data:

If your `sales` column contains values like:

- 123.4500 → becomes 123.45
- 00045.670 → becomes 45.67
- 120.000 → becomes 120

The CAST to FLOAT method will automatically handle these conversions in most database systems.
