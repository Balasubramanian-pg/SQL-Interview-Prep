Here are complete solutions for unpivoting data in different SQL dialects:

## SQL Server (SSMS) UNPIVOT Solution

```SQL
-- SQL Server UNPIVOT (works in SSMS)
SELECT
    Category,
    Year,
    Sales
FROM
    (SELECT
        Category,
        [2015], [2016], [2017], [2018], [2019], [2020]
     FROM Saless) AS SourceTable
UNPIVOT
(
    Sales FOR Year IN ([2015], [2016], [2017], [2018], [2019], [2020])
) AS UnpivotedData
ORDER BY Category, Year;
```

## MySQL Solution (using UNION ALL)

```SQL
-- MySQL approach (no UNPIVOT operator)
SELECT Category, '2015' AS Year, `2015` AS Sales FROM Saless
UNION ALL
SELECT Category, '2016' AS Year, `2016` AS Sales FROM Saless
UNION ALL
SELECT Category, '2017' AS Year, `2017` AS Sales FROM Saless
UNION ALL
SELECT Category, '2018' AS Year, `2018` AS Sales FROM Saless
UNION ALL
SELECT Category, '2019' AS Year, `2019` AS Sales FROM Saless
UNION ALL
SELECT Category, '2020' AS Year, `2020` AS Sales FROM Saless
ORDER BY Category, Year;
```

## Standard SQL (Cross Join with VALUES)

```SQL
-- Standard SQL approach (works in many modern databases)
SELECT
    s.Category,
    y.Year,
    CASE y.Year
        WHEN '2015' THEN s.`2015`
        WHEN '2016' THEN s.`2016`
        WHEN '2017' THEN s.`2017`
        WHEN '2018' THEN s.`2018`
        WHEN '2019' THEN s.`2019`
        WHEN '2020' THEN s.`2020`
    END AS Sales
FROM
    Saless s
CROSS JOIN
    (VALUES ('2015'), ('2016'), ('2017'), ('2018'), ('2019'), ('2020')) AS y(Year)
ORDER BY
    s.Category, y.Year;
```

## Expected Output (All Methods):

For the sample data, all approaches will produce:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Category|Year|Sales|
|Cold Drinks|2015|18000|
|Cold Drinks|2016|36000|
|Cold Drinks|2017|10000|
|Cold Drinks|2018|12000|
|Cold Drinks|2019|8000|
|Cold Drinks|2020|2000|
|Hot Drinks|2015|20000|
|Hot Drinks|2016|15000|
|Hot Drinks|2017|28000|
|Hot Drinks|2018|12000|
|Hot Drinks|2019|40000|
|Hot Drinks|2020|10000|

## Key Considerations:

1. **SQL Server UNPIVOT**:
    - Most efficient for SQL Server
    - Requires column names in square brackets
    - Explicitly defines the new column names (Sales and Year)
2. **MySQL Approach**:
    - Uses multiple UNION ALL statements
    - More verbose but universally supported
    - Can be slow for large datasets with many columns
3. **Standard SQL**:
    - Most portable across modern databases
    - Uses CROSS JOIN with a derived table of years
    - Flexible for dynamic column handling

Choose the method that best fits your database system and requirements.
