This solution calculates the total number of users and total amount spent categorized by platform usage (mobile only, desktop only, or both) for each date.

## Complete Solution

```SQL
WITH user_platform_summary AS (
    -- Users who used only one platform (mobile or desktop)
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        user_id,
        MAX(platform) AS platform,
        SUM(amount) AS amount
    FROM spending
    GROUP BY spend_date, user_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1

    UNION ALL

    -- Users who used both platforms
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        user_id,
        'Both' AS platform,
        SUM(amount) AS amount
    FROM spending
    GROUP BY spend_date, user_id
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 2

    UNION ALL

    -- Ensure all platform categories appear for each date
    SELECT DISTINCT
        spend_date,
        NULL AS user_id,
        platform,
        0 AS amount
    FROM spending
    CROSS JOIN (SELECT 'mobile' AS platform UNION SELECT 'desktop' UNION SELECT 'Both') platforms
),

final_results AS (
    SELECT
        spend_date,
        platform,
        SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users
    FROM user_platform_summary
    GROUP BY spend_date, platform
)

SELECT
    spend_date,
    platform,
    total_amount,
    total_users
FROM final_results
ORDER BY spend_date,
    CASE platform
        WHEN 'Both' THEN 3
        WHEN 'desktop' THEN 2
        WHEN 'mobile' THEN 1
    END;
```

## Explanation:

1. **First CTE (**`**user_platform_summary**`**)**:
    - Identifies users who used only one platform (mobile or desktop) with `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 1`
    - Identifies users who used both platforms with `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT platform) = 2`
    - Adds dummy records to ensure all platform categories appear for each date
2. **Second CTE (**`**final_results**`**)**:
    - Calculates the total amount spent and counts distinct users
    - Groups by date and platform type
3. **Final Query**:
    - Returns the results ordered by date and platform type (Both > desktop > mobile)
    - Shows the platform, total amount spent, and number of users for each category

## Expected Output:

For the sample data, the query would return:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|spend_date|platform|total_amount|total_users|
|2019-07-01|mobile|100|1|
|2019-07-01|desktop|100|1|
|2019-07-01|Both|200|1|
|2019-07-02|mobile|100|1|
|2019-07-02|desktop|100|1|
|2019-07-02|Both|0|0|

This shows:

- On 2019-07-01:
    - 1 user spent $100 on mobile only
    - 1 user spent $100 on desktop only
    - 1 user spent $200 using both platforms
- On 2019-07-02:
    - 1 user spent $100 on mobile only
    - 1 user spent $100 on desktop only
    - No users used both platforms
