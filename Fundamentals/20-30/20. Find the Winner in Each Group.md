Here's the solution to find the winner in each group based on the maximum total points, with the lowest player ID breaking ties:

```SQL
WITH player_scores AS (
    -- Combine scores from both first and second players
    SELECT first_player AS player_id, first_score AS score FROM matches
    UNION ALL
    SELECT second_player AS player_id, second_score AS score FROM matches
),
-- Calculate total scores for each player
player_totals AS (
    SELECT
        p.group_id,
        ps.player_id,
        SUM(ps.score) AS total_score
    FROM player_scores ps
    INNER JOIN players p ON ps.player_id = p.player_id
    GROUP BY p.group_id, ps.player_id
),
-- Rank players within each group
group_rankings AS (
    SELECT
        group_id,
        player_id,
        total_score,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY total_score DESC, player_id ASC) AS rank_in_group
    FROM player_totals
)
-- Select the top-ranked player from each group
SELECT
    group_id,
    player_id AS winner_id,
    total_score
FROM group_rankings
WHERE rank_in_group = 1
ORDER BY group_id;
```

## Explanation:

1. **player_scores CTE**:
    - Combines all player scores from both positions (first_player and second_player) in each match
    - Uses UNION ALL to preserve all score records
2. **player_totals CTE**:
    - Joins with the players table to get group information
    - Calculates the total score for each player across all matches
    - Groups by group_id and player_id
3. **group_rankings CTE**:
    - Uses RANK() to order players within each group by:
        - Total score (descending) - higher scores rank better
        - Player ID (ascending) - lower IDs break ties
    - This ensures the tiebreaker rule is implemented
4. **Final Query**:
    - Selects only the top-ranked player (rank = 1) from each group
    - Returns the group_id, winning player_id, and their total_score
    - Ordered by group_id for clear presentation

## Expected Output:

For the provided data, the query should return:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|group_id|winner_id|total_score|
|1|15|5|
|2|35|1|
|3|40|5|

This shows:

- Group 1 winner is player 15 with 5 points
- Group 2 winner is player 35 with 1 point (tie broken by lower ID)
- Group 3 winner is player 40 with 5 points
