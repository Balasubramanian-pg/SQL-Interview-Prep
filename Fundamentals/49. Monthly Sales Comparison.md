Here's a comprehensive solution to compare monthly sales with:

1. Previous month
2. Same month previous year
3. First month of the year

```SQL
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(order_date) AS year,
        MONTH(order_date) AS month,
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM superstore_orders
    WHERE YEAR(order_date) IN (2012, 2013)
    GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
)
SELECT
    year,
    month,
    total_sales AS current_month_sales,

    -- Comparison with previous month
    LAG(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) AS previous_month_sales,
    total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) AS month_over_month_change,
    ROUND((total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY year, month)) * 100.0 /
        NULLIF(LAG(total_sales) OVER(ORDER BY year, month), 0), 2) AS mom_pct_change,

    -- Comparison with same month last year
    LAG(total_sales, 12) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) AS same_month_last_year,
    total_sales - LAG(total_sales, 12) OVER(ORDER BY year, month) AS year_over_year_change,
    ROUND((total_sales - LAG(total_sales, 12) OVER(ORDER BY year, month)) * 100.0 /
        NULLIF(LAG(total_sales, 12) OVER(ORDER BY year, month), 0), 2) AS yoy_pct_change,

    -- Comparison with first month of year
    FIRST_VALUE(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY month) AS first_month_sales,
    total_sales - FIRST_VALUE(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY month) AS vs_first_month_change,
    ROUND((total_sales - FIRST_VALUE(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY month)) * 100.0 /
        NULLIF(FIRST_VALUE(total_sales) OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY month), 0), 2) AS vs_first_month_pct_change
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY year, month;
```

## Key Features:

1. **Month-over-Month Comparison**:
    - Shows previous month's sales
    - Calculates absolute and percentage change
2. **Year-over-Year Comparison**:
    - Compares with same month in previous year
    - Uses offset of 12 months in LAG function
3. **First Month Comparison**:
    - Uses FIRST_VALUE to get January sales
    - Shows change since beginning of year
4. **Robust Calculations**:
    - Handles NULL values with NULLIF to avoid division by zero
    - Rounds percentage changes to 2 decimal places

## Alternative Version (Using Your Original Approach):

```SQL
SELECT
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month,
    SUM(sales) AS current_sales,

    -- Previous month
    LAG(SUM(sales)) OVER(ORDER BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)) AS prev_month_sales,

    -- Same month previous year
    LAG(SUM(sales), 12) OVER(ORDER BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)) AS prev_year_same_month,

    -- First month of year
    FIRST_VALUE(SUM(sales)) OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(order_date) ORDER BY MONTH(order_date)) AS first_month_sales
FROM superstore_orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) IN (2012, 2013)
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```

This query provides all three comparison points in a single efficient query, making it easy to analyze sales trends across different time dimensions.
