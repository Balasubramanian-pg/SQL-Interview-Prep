Here are several methods to calculate the first and last day of the week in SQL Server:

## Method 1: Using DATEADD and DATEDIFF (Fixed Reference Date)

```SQL
-- First day of current week (Sunday)
SELECT DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, 0, GETDATE()), 0) AS first_day_of_week;

-- Last day of current week (Saturday)
SELECT DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, 0, GETDATE()) + 1, -1) AS last_day_of_week;
```

## Method 2: Using DATEFIRST Setting (Respects Local Settings)

```SQL
-- First day of current week (respects @@DATEFIRST setting)
SELECT DATEADD(day, -(DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) - @@DATEFIRST) % 7, GETDATE()) AS first_day_of_week;

-- Last day of current week
SELECT DATEADD(day, 6 - (DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) - @@DATEFIRST) % 7, GETDATE()) AS last_day_of_week;
```

## Method 3: For a Specific Date

```SQL
DECLARE @date DATE = '2021-08-05';

-- First day of the week containing @date (Sunday)
SELECT DATEADD(day, -(DATEPART(weekday, @date) - 1) % 7, @date) AS first_day_of_week;

-- Last day of the week containing @date (Saturday)
SELECT DATEADD(day, 6 - (DATEPART(weekday, @date) - 1) % 7, @date) AS last_day_of_week;
```

## Method 4: ISO Week Standard (Monday as first day)

```SQL
-- ISO first day of week (Monday)
SELECT DATEADD(day, -(DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) + @@DATEFIRST - 2) % 7, GETDATE()) AS iso_first_day_of_week;

-- ISO last day of week (Sunday)
SELECT DATEADD(day, 6 - (DATEPART(weekday, GETDATE()) + @@DATEFIRST - 2) % 7, GETDATE()) AS iso_last_day_of_week;
```

## Calculating Week Difference Between Dates

```SQL
-- Weeks between two dates
SELECT DATEDIFF(week, '2021-08-05', GETDATE()) AS weeks_difference;

-- Your specific example corrected
SELECT DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, '2021-08-01', GETDATE()), '2021-08-01') AS current_week_start;
SELECT DATEADD(wk, DATEDIFF(wk, '2021-08-01', GETDATE()) + 1, '2021-08-01') AS next_week_start;
```

## Key Notes:

1. The methods using `@@DATEFIRST` respect your server's week start setting
2. Method 1 assumes Sunday as the first day (SQL Server default)
3. Method 4 follows ISO standard (Monday as first day)
4. For accurate business week calculations, consider your organization's specific week definition

Choose the method that best matches your business requirements for week start day.
