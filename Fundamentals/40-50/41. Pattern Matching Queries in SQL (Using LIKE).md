## **1. Extract Customers Whose Names Start or End with ‘A’**

```SQL
-- Customer names that start with 'A'
SELECT Customer_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Customer_Name LIKE 'A%';

-- Customer names that end with 'A'
SELECT Customer_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Customer_Name LIKE '%A';
```

### **Explanation:**

- `'A%'` → Finds names **starting** with 'A'.
- `'%A'` → Finds names **ending** with 'A'.

## **2. Find Customer Names Matching a Specific Pattern**

```SQL
-- Customers whose names are 3 characters long and end with 'an'
SELECT Customer_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Customer_Name LIKE '_an';
```

### **Explanation:**

- The underscore `_` represents **a single character**.
- This query fetches names where:
    - The **first letter can be anything**.
    - The **next two letters must be ‘an’**.
    - Example results: `"Dan"`, `"Jan"`.

## **3. Find Customers Whose Names Start with A, C, or D**

```SQL
SELECT Customer_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Customer_Name LIKE '[ACD]%';
```

### **Explanation:**

- `'[ACD]%'` → Finds names **starting with either ‘A’, ‘C’, or ‘D’**.

## **4. Find Products Starting or Not Starting with Certain Letters**

```SQL
-- Products whose names start with A-P
SELECT Product_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Product_Name LIKE '[A-P]%';

-- Products whose names DO NOT start with A-P
SELECT Product_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Product_Name LIKE '[^A-P]%';
```

### **Explanation:**

- `'[A-P]%'` → Finds products **starting with any letter from A to P**.
- `'[^A-P]%'` → Finds products **NOT starting with A to P**.

## **5. Find Order IDs Where the 3rd Character is a Hyphen (‘-’)**

```SQL
SELECT ORDER_ID FROM superstore_orders
WHERE ORDER_ID LIKE '__-%';
```

### **Explanation:**

- `'__-%'` → Ensures:
    - **First two characters** can be **anything**.
    - **Third character** must be a **hyphen ('-')**.
    - Example results: `"XX-123"`, `"A1-456"`.

## **6. Find Products Containing ‘10/’**

```SQL
SELECT Product_Name FROM superstore_orders
WHERE Product_Name LIKE '%10[/]%';
```

### **Explanation:**

- `'%10[/]%'` → Searches for **products containing '10/' anywhere in the name**.
- The brackets `[/]` **ensure SQL treats '/' as a literal character** instead of an operator.
- Example results: `"Printer 10/ModelX"`, `"Scanner 10/2023"`.

## **Key Benefits of** `**LIKE**` **Queries in SQL**

✔ **Flexible Pattern Matching** → Allows filtering based on specific text patterns.

✔ **Wildcard Support** → `_` for single characters, `%` for multiple characters.

✔ **Character Set Filters** → `[ ]` for lists, `[^ ]` for exclusions.

✔ **Optimized Text Searches** → Useful for **name filters, ID patterns, and product searches**.

### **Performance Tip**

- Indexing **text columns** (`VARCHAR`, `TEXT`) **improves LIKE query performance**.
- Avoid leading wildcards (`'%A'`) **if performance is critical**, as it results in full table scans.
