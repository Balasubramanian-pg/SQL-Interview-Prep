## 1. **Using** `**VALUES()**` **for Column-Wise Maximum** (SSMS Only)

To determine the maximum value among multiple columns, you can use a **derived table** with the `VALUES` clause:

```SQL
SELECT category,
       (SELECT MAX(sales)
        FROM (VALUES ([2015]), ([2016]), ([2017]), ([2018]), ([2019]), ([2020]))
        AS salesTable(sales)) AS maxSales
FROM saless;
```

### Explanation:

- `VALUES()` creates a virtual table with column values converted into rows.
- `MAX(sales)` finds the maximum value from the derived table.
- The result is the **highest value** among the specified columns.

## 2. **Using** `**VALUES()**` **for Hardcoded Data**

For testing without an actual table:

```SQL
SELECT MAX(A)
FROM (VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4)) AS tbl(A);
```

### Explanation:

- The `VALUES` clause creates an **inline table**.
- `MAX(A)` returns the **largest number** from the given values.

### Alternative Approach for Standard SQL (Without `VALUES()`)

For databases that do not support `VALUES()`, use `GREATEST()` (if available) or `UNION ALL`:

```SQL
SELECT category,
       GREATEST([2015], [2016], [2017], [2018], [2019], [2020]) AS maxSales
FROM saless;
```

**OR (For MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.):**

```SQL
SELECT category, MAX(sales) AS maxSales
FROM (
    SELECT category, [2015] AS sales FROM saless
    UNION ALL
    SELECT category, [2016] FROM saless
    UNION ALL
    SELECT category, [2017] FROM saless
    UNION ALL
    SELECT category, [2018] FROM saless
    UNION ALL
    SELECT category, [2019] FROM saless
    UNION ALL
    SELECT category, [2020] FROM saless
) AS salesData
GROUP BY category;
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- **SSMS**: `VALUES()` works well for inline table transformations.
- **Other SQL Engines**: Use `GREATEST()` (if supported) or `UNION ALL` for compatibility.
- **Performance**: `GREATEST()` is usually faster, but `UNION ALL` with `MAX()` works universally.
