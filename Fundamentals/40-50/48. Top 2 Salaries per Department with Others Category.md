Here's an optimized solution to get the top 2 highest salaries in each department along with a sum of all other salaries:

```SQL
WITH ranked_salaries AS (
    SELECT
        emp_name,
        department_id,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM empm
)
-- Top 2 salaries in each department
SELECT
    emp_name,
    department_id,
    salary
FROM ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank <= 2

UNION ALL

-- Sum of all other salaries grouped by department
SELECT
    'Others' AS emp_name,
    department_id,
    SUM(salary) AS salary
FROM ranked_salaries
WHERE salary_rank > 2
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY department_id,
    CASE WHEN emp_name = 'Others' THEN 2 ELSE 1 END,
    salary DESC;
```

## Key Improvements:

1. **Single CTE for both queries**:
    - Uses `DENSE_RANK()` to properly handle salary ties
    - Calculates ranks just once for better performance
2. **Better sorting**:
    - Orders by department first
    - Shows "Others" after the top earners
    - Sorts salaries in descending order within each group
3. **Clearer output**:
    - Maintains consistent column names
    - Properly labels the aggregated row as "Others"

## Performance Notes:

1. `UNION ALL` is more efficient than `UNION` since:
    - It doesn't attempt to remove duplicates
    - In this case, we know the two result sets won't overlap
2. The CTE approach is better than subqueries because:
    - It calculates the ranking just once
    - Makes the query more readable and maintainable

## Alternative Version (Using ROW_NUMBER):

```SQL
WITH salary_ranks AS (
    SELECT
        emp_name,
        department_id,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
    FROM empm
)
SELECT emp_name, department_id, salary
FROM salary_ranks
WHERE row_num <= 2

UNION ALL

SELECT
    'Others',
    department_id,
    SUM(salary)
FROM salary_ranks
WHERE row_num > 2
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY department_id,
    CASE WHEN emp_name = 'Others' THEN 2 ELSE 1 END,
    salary DESC;
```

Choose `DENSE_RANK()` if you want to include all employees who tie for top salaries, or `ROW_NUMBER()` if you want exactly 2 rows per department regardless of ties.
