## **SQL Query**

```SQL
SELECT
    surveyid,
    response,
    LENGTH(response) AS total_length,
    LENGTH(REPLACE(response, 'Y', '')) AS length_without_Y,
    LENGTH(response) - LENGTH(REPLACE(response, 'Y', '')) AS occurrences_of_Y
FROM survey;
```

### **Alternative Query (Optimized for Readability)**

```SQL
SELECT
    surveyid,
    response,
    LENGTH(response) - LENGTH(REPLACE(response, 'Y', '')) AS occurrences_of_Y
FROM survey;
```

## **Explanation**

This query calculates the number of times the character `'Y'` appears in each survey response.

### **How the Query Works**

1. `**LENGTH(response)**`
    - Retrieves the total length of the `response` string.
2. `**REPLACE(response, 'Y', '')**`
    - Removes all occurrences of `'Y'` from the `response`.
3. `**LENGTH(REPLACE(response, 'Y', ''))**`
    - Measures the length of the string after removing `'Y'`.
4. `**LENGTH(response) - LENGTH(REPLACE(response, 'Y', ''))**`
    - Subtracting the new length from the original gives the count of `'Y'`.

## **Execution Steps**

1. **Run the query** to count occurrences of `'Y'` in each response.
2. **Review results** to analyze response patterns.

## **Expected Output (Example)**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|SurveyID|Response|Occurrences_of_Y|
|1|ZZZZZXXXXCCCVVVBBNNMMLLKHJFGDFSDASASSAAQWEWERETRTYRYIYYIOIPUT|4|
|2|QWPDHBCNFDHFFGALSDDCS|0|

## **Key Benefits**

- **Text Analysis**: Helps analyze **survey responses** for character frequency.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifies **unexpected character usage** in survey data.
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses `REPLACE()` and `LENGTH()`, which are **efficient for text processing** in SQL.

### **Additional Insights**

- **For Case Sensitivity**:
    - If case variation exists (`'y'` vs. `'Y'`), use `LOWER(response)` or `UPPER(response)`.
- **For More General Character Frequency Analysis**:
    - Convert this method into a stored procedure to dynamically count **any character** in survey responses.
