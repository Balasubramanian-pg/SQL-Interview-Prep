## 1. Cricket Tournament Points Table

```SQL
SELECT
    team_name,
    COUNT(1) AS no_of_matches_played,
    SUM(win_flag) AS no_of_matches_won,
    COUNT(1) - SUM(win_flag) AS no_of_losses,
    SUM(win_flag) * 2 AS points  -- Assuming 2 points per win
FROM (
    -- Team 1 performance
    SELECT
        team_1 AS team_name,
        CASE WHEN team_1 = winner THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS win_flag
    FROM icc_world_cup

    UNION ALL

    -- Team 2 performance
    SELECT
        team_2 AS team_name,
        CASE WHEN team_2 = winner THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS win_flag
    FROM icc_world_cup
) A
GROUP BY team_name
ORDER BY points DESC, no_of_matches_won DESC;
```

**Key Improvements**:

1. Added `points` calculation (2 points per win as standard in cricket)
2. Enhanced sorting - first by points, then by matches won
3. Used more descriptive column aliases
