This note details how to capitalize the first letter of a string in SQL Server, along with explanations and examples.

```SQL
SELECT FirstName,
       UPPER(LEFT(FirstName, 1)) + SUBSTRING(FirstName, 2, LEN(FirstName)) AS CapitalizedFirstName
FROM dbo.Emp;
```

## Explanation

This query capitalizes the first letter of the `FirstName` column in the `dbo.Emp` table. It achieves this by:

1. `**LEFT(FirstName, 1)**`: Extracts the first character of the `FirstName` column.
2. `**UPPER(...)**`: Converts the extracted first character to uppercase.
3. `**SUBSTRING(FirstName, 2, LEN(FirstName))**`: Extracts the remaining portion of the `FirstName` column, starting from the second character. `LEN(FirstName)` determines the length of the string, ensuring the entire remaining portion is captured.
4. `**+**`: Concatenates the uppercase first character with the remaining portion of the string.
5. `**AS CapitalizedFirstName**`: Assigns an alias to the resulting capitalized string for better readability in the output.

## Execution Steps

1. The query selects the original `FirstName` column and a new calculated column named `CapitalizedFirstName`.
2. For each row in the `dbo.Emp` table, the `LEFT` function extracts the first character.
3. The `UPPER` function converts this character to uppercase.
4. The `SUBSTRING` function extracts the rest of the string.
5. The `+` operator combines the uppercase first character with the rest of the string.
6. The result is displayed in the `CapitalizedFirstName` column alongside the original `FirstName`.

## Expected Output

Assuming the `dbo.Emp` table contains the following data:

| FirstName |  
|---|---|  
| john |  
| jane |  
| robert |  
| sarah |  

The query will produce the following output:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|FirstName|CapitalizedFirstName|
|john|John|
|jane|Jane|
|robert|Robert|
|sarah|Sarah|

## Key Benefits

- **Data Consistency:** Ensures consistent capitalization of names or other string data.
- **Improved Presentation:** Enhances the readability and professional appearance of data.
- **Simple Implementation:** The query is relatively straightforward and easy to understand.

## Alternative Solution (for older SQL Server versions without `UPPER`)

While `UPPER` is standard SQL, older versions might not support it directly. You can use `CONVERT` with a style code to achieve the same result:

```SQL
SELECT FirstName,
       CONVERT(VARCHAR, LEFT(FirstName, 1), 1) + SUBSTRING(FirstName, 2, LEN(FirstName)) AS CapitalizedFirstName
FROM dbo.Emp;
```

This alternative uses `CONVERT(VARCHAR, ..., 1)` to convert the first character to uppercase. The style code `1` typically represents the default collation, which will handle uppercase conversion. However, the `UPPER` function is generally preferred for clarity and portability.
