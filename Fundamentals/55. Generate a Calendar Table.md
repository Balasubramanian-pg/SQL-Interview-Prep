Here's a comprehensive solution to generate a complete calendar table with various date attributes:

## Complete Calendar Table Generator

```SQL
DECLARE @startdate DATE = '2020-01-01';
DECLARE @enddate DATE = '2020-12-31';

WITH CalendarCTE AS (
    SELECT
        @startdate AS [Date],
        DATEPART(DAY, @startdate) AS [Day],
        DATEPART(MONTH, @startdate) AS [Month],
        DATEPART(YEAR, @startdate) AS [Year],
        DATENAME(WEEKDAY, @startdate) AS [DayName],
        DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @startdate) AS [DayOfWeek],
        DATEPART(QUARTER, @startdate) AS [Quarter],
        DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, @startdate) AS [DayOfYear],
        CASE WHEN DATEPART(WEEKDAY, @startdate) IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS [IsWeekend]

    UNION ALL

    SELECT
        DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date]),
        DATEPART(DAY, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATEPART(MONTH, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATEPART(YEAR, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATENAME(WEEKDAY, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATEPART(WEEKDAY, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATEPART(QUARTER, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        DATEPART(DAYOFYEAR, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])),
        CASE WHEN DATEPART(WEEKDAY, DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date])) IN (1, 7) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    FROM CalendarCTE
    WHERE DATEADD(DAY, 1, [Date]) <= @enddate
)
SELECT
    [Date],
    [Day],
    [Month],
    [Year],
    [DayName],
    [DayOfWeek],
    [Quarter],
    [DayOfYear],
    [IsWeekend],
    CASE
        WHEN [Month] IN (1, 2, 12) THEN 'Winter'
        WHEN [Month] IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
        WHEN [Month] IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
        ELSE 'Fall'
    END AS [Season],
    CONVERT(VARCHAR, [Date], 101) AS [FormattedDate],
    EOMONTH([Date]) AS [MonthEndDate]
FROM CalendarCTE
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 3660); -- Allows for up to 10 years of dates
```

## Key Features:

1. **Date Generation**:
    - Creates all dates between specified start and end dates
    - Uses recursive CTE to increment each day
2. **Comprehensive Date Attributes**:
    - Basic components (day, month, year)
    - Day names and numbers
    - Quarters and day of year
    - Weekend identification
    - Season calculation
    - Month end dates
3. **Flexibility**:
    - Easily extendable with additional columns
    - MAXRECURSION can be adjusted for longer date ranges

## How to Use:

1. Change `@startdate` and `@enddate` to your desired range
2. Add or remove columns as needed for your specific requirements
3. Execute to generate a complete calendar table

## Alternative for Large Date Ranges:

For generating more than ~10 years of dates (over 3660 days), consider:

```SQL
-- Create a permanent numbers table first
CREATE TABLE Numbers (n INT PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO Numbers SELECT TOP 10000 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL))-1 FROM sys.objects;

-- Then use it to generate dates
DECLARE @startdate DATE = '2000-01-01';
DECLARE @enddate DATE = '2030-12-31';

SELECT
    DATEADD(DAY, n, @startdate) AS [Date],
    -- Add all other date attributes as needed
FROM Numbers
WHERE DATEADD(DAY, n, @startdate) <= @enddate;
```
