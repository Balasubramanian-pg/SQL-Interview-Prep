## Problem Statement

Find the customer with the highest daily total order cost between 2019-02-01 and 2019-05-01. If a customer had multiple orders on the same day, sum their order costs. Output first name, total cost, and date.

## Solution Query

```SQL
SELECT first_name, total_order_cost, order_date
FROM (
    SELECT
        first_name,
        SUM(total_order_cost) AS total_order_cost,
        order_date,
        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(total_order_cost) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.cust_id
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'
    GROUP BY first_name, order_date
) sub
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

## Key Components Explained

1. **Date Filtering**:
    - `WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'` restricts analysis to the specified period
2. **Data Aggregation**:
    - `GROUP BY first_name, order_date` groups orders by customer and day
    - `SUM(total_order_cost)` calculates the daily total for each customer
3. **Ranking System**:
    - `RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(total_order_cost) DESC)` assigns ranks based on daily spending
    - DESC puts highest spenders at rank 1
4. **Final Filter**:
    - Outer query selects only rows with rank 1 (highest daily spend)

## Important Features

1. **Handles Multiple Orders**:
    - The SUM() function combines costs when a customer has multiple orders in one day
2. **Date Range Filter**:
    - Properly includes all dates in the specified 3-month period
3. **Ranking Considerations**:
    - Uses RANK() which will give the same rank to tied values
    - If multiple customers tie for highest daily spend, all will be returned
4. **Join Logic**:
    - Simple INNER JOIN connects customer info with order data

## Alternative Approaches

1. Using DENSE_RANK() instead of RANK():
    - Would produce the same result unless there are gaps in spending amounts
2. Using a CTE for better readability:

```SQL
WITH daily_totals AS (
    SELECT
        first_name,
        SUM(total_order_cost) AS total_order_cost,
        order_date
    FROM customers c
    JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.cust_id
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2019-02-01' AND '2019-05-01'
    GROUP BY first_name, order_date
)
SELECT first_name, total_order_cost, order_date
FROM daily_totals
WHERE total_order_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_order_cost) FROM daily_totals);
```

## Learning Points

1. Always consider whether to use RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), or ROW_NUMBER() based on needs
2. Date ranges should be carefully constructed to include/exclude boundaries
3. Aggregation (SUM with GROUP BY) is essential for combining multiple transactions
4. Subqueries or CTEs can improve query organization for complex analyses
