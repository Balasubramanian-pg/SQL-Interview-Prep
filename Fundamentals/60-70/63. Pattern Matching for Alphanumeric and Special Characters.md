Here's a comprehensive guide to filtering data based on character patterns:

## 1. Basic Alphanumeric Checks

```SQL
-- Contains only alphanumeric characters (no spaces or special chars)
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';
```

## 2. Advanced Pattern Matching

```SQL
-- Contains at least one letter and one number (in any order)
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name LIKE '%[a-zA-Z]%'
AND column_name LIKE '%[0-9]%'
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';
```

## 3. Allowing Specific Special Characters

```SQL
-- Allows alphanumeric plus spaces
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]%';

-- Allows alphanumeric plus hyphens
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9-]%';

-- Allows alphanumeric plus hyphens and forward slashes
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9/-]%';

-- Allows alphanumeric plus parentheses and hyphens
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9()-]%';
```

## 4. Finding Invalid Patterns

```SQL
-- Contains any non-alphanumeric characters
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';

-- Contains any non-alphanumeric characters (including specific check)
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND (
    column_name LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%'  -- General non-alphanumeric
    OR column_name NOT LIKE '%[0-9]%'  -- Missing numbers
    OR column_name NOT LIKE '%[a-zA-Z]%'  -- Missing letters
);
```

## 5. Case-Sensitive Matching (SQL Server)

```SQL
-- Case-sensitive alphanumeric check
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN NOT LIKE '%[^a-zA-Z0-9]%';
```

## Important Notes:

1. The `NOT LIKE '%[^...]%'` pattern means "does not contain any characters other than these"
2. For case-insensitive matching, use `a-z`; for case-sensitive, use `a-zA-Z`
3. Different SQL dialects may have slightly different pattern matching syntax
4. For complex validations, consider using CHECK constraints or application logic

## MySQL Alternative:

```SQL
-- MySQL regex version for alphanumeric only
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL
AND column_name REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9]+$';
```

These patterns are useful for data validation, especially when checking:

- Usernames
- Product codes
- Identification numbers
- Any fields requiring specific character restrictions
