The query you provided has a logical error in the JOIN condition. Let me explain the issue and provide the correct solution.

## The Problem in Your Query

Your current join condition `f.personid=p.person_id` is incorrect because:

1. It joins each person with themselves rather than their friends
2. It sums the person's own score rather than their friends' scores

## Correct Solution

```SQL
WITH friend_scores AS (
    SELECT
        f.personid,
        SUM(p.score) AS total_friend_score,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_friends
    FROM friend f
    INNER JOIN person p ON f.friend_id = p.person_id  -- Correct join: link to friends' records
    GROUP BY f.personid
    HAVING SUM(p.score) > 100
)
SELECT
    p.person_id,
    p.name,
    fs.number_of_friends,
    fs.total_friend_score,
    p.score AS personal_score
FROM person p
INNER JOIN friend_scores fs ON p.person_id = fs.personid;
```

## Explanation

1. **Correct Join Condition**:
    - `f.friend_id = p.person_id` properly links each person to their friends' records
    - This ensures we're calculating the sum of friends' scores, not the person's own score
2. **CTE (friend_scores)**:
    - Groups by `personid` (the person whose friends we're analyzing)
    - For each person:
        - Calculates total score of all their friends (`SUM(p.score)`)
        - Counts their number of friends (`COUNT(*)`)
        - Filters to only include people whose friends have combined score > 100
3. **Final Query**:
    - Joins the CTE with the person table to:
        - Get the person's details (name, personal score)
        - Show the friend analysis from the CTE

## Expected Results

Based on your sample data, the query would return:

|   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|person_id|name|number_of_friends|total_friend_score|personal_score|
|2|bob|2|115 (Alice:88 + davis:27)|11|
|4|tara|3|101 (bob:11 + davis:27 + john:63)|45|

## Key Differences from Your Original Query

1. Fixed the join condition to properly link to friends' records
2. Added the person's own score to the output for context
3. Used more descriptive column aliases
4. Structured the query for better readability

This solution correctly identifies people whose friends collectively have a total score greater than 100, along with their personal details and friend count.
