Here's the complete solution for pivoting the data from the `pemp` table:

```SQL
-- PIVOT operation to transform rows into columns
SELECT
    ID,
    [Name],
    [Gender],
    [Salary]
FROM
(
    -- Source data for pivoting
    SELECT
        ID,
        Name AS e_name,  -- This will become column names
        Value            -- This will become cell values
    FROM pemp
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT
(
    MAX(Value)          -- Aggregation function (MAX works well for this case)
    FOR e_name IN ([Name], [Gender], [Salary])  -- Columns to create
) AS PivotTable;
```

## Explanation:

1. **Inner Query (SourceTable)**:
    - Selects the ID, Name (aliased as e_name), and Value columns
    - Provides the raw data needed for pivoting
2. **PIVOT Operation**:
    - `MAX(Value)` - Aggregates the values (though there's only one value per ID/Name combination)
    - `FOR e_name IN ([Name], [Gender], [Salary])` - Specifies which values become columns
3. **Output**:
    - Creates a table with ID as row identifier
    - Transforms the Name/Value pairs into columns

## Expected Output:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|ID|Name|Gender|Salary|
|1|Adam|Male|50000|

## Alternative Solution (Using CASE Statements):

```SQL
-- Alternative approach without PIVOT (works in most SQL dialects)
SELECT
    ID,
    MAX(CASE WHEN Name = 'Name' THEN Value END) AS [Name],
    MAX(CASE WHEN Name = 'Gender' THEN Value END) AS [Gender],
    MAX(CASE WHEN Name = 'Salary' THEN Value END) AS [Salary]
FROM pemp
GROUP BY ID;
```

## Key Notes:

1. The PIVOT operation requires an aggregate function (MAX, MIN, SUM, etc.)
2. Column names in the IN clause must match exactly with values in the e_name column
3. For databases without PIVOT (like MySQL), use the CASE statement approach
4. The MAX function works here because there's only one value per ID/Name combination

This transformation is particularly useful when you need to convert EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) data models into a more traditional row/column format for reporting or analysis.
