# Time Series Data Analysis  

## 1. **Problem Statement**  
Given a `temperature_readings` table with:  
- `reading_id`  
- `sensor_id`  
- `reading_time` (timestamp)  
- `temperature`  

We need to:  
1. Extract just the date from the timestamp.  
2. Calculate the average temperature for each date.  
3. Round the results to 2 decimal places.  
4. Order the results by date.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem tests your ability to handle time series data, perform aggregation, and format results in SQL.  

## 2. **Solution Code**  
```sql
SELECT
    DATE(reading_time) AS reading_date,
    ROUND(AVG(temperature), 2) AS average_temperature
FROM
    temperature_readings
GROUP BY
    DATE(reading_time)
ORDER BY
    DATE(reading_time);
```  

## 3. **Explanation**  

### 3.1 **DATE() Function**  
- **Purpose**: Extracts just the date portion from the timestamp.  
- **Example**: Converts `"2023-07-01 08:30:00"` to `"2023-07-01"`.  

> [!TIP]  
> Use `DATE()` to focus on daily aggregation, ignoring time components.  

### 3.2 **AVG() Function**  
- **Purpose**: Calculates the average temperature for all readings on each date.  
- **Interaction**: Works with `GROUP BY` to aggregate data by date.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure the `temperature` column contains numeric values for accurate averaging.  

### 3.3 **ROUND() Function**  
- **Purpose**: Formats the average temperature to 2 decimal places.  
- **Example**: Converts `27.4666667` to `27.47`.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Use `ROUND()` for better readability of floating-point numbers.  

### 3.4 **GROUP BY**  
- **Purpose**: Groups all readings by their date for aggregation.  
- **Requirement**: Must match the expression used in the `SELECT` clause (`DATE(reading_time)`).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `GROUP BY` is essential for per-date aggregation.  

### 3.5 **ORDER BY**  
- **Purpose**: Sorts the results chronologically by date.  
- **Benefit**: Ensures a logical presentation of time series data.  

> [!TIP]  
> Always sort time series data chronologically for easier analysis.  

## 4. **Key Concepts**  

### 4.1 **Time Series Analysis**  
- **Use Case**: Common for IoT/sensor data.  
- **Focus**: Aggregating measurements over time periods (daily, monthly, etc.).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Time series analysis is crucial for monitoring trends and patterns over time.  

### 4.2 **Date Extraction**  
- **Purpose**: Essential when analyzing data by day/month/year.  
- **Variations**: Different databases may use `DATE()`, `CAST()`, or `TRUNCATE()`.  

> [!TIP]  
> Familiarize yourself with date functions specific to your SQL dialect.  

### 4.3 **Data Aggregation**  
- **Function**: `AVG()` calculates the mean temperature.  
- **Alternatives**: Use `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `SUM()`, or `COUNT()` as needed.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Choose the aggregation function based on the analysis requirement.  

### 4.4 **Result Formatting**  
- **Function**: `ROUND()` improves presentation.  
- **Alternatives**: Use `TRUNCATE()` or database-specific formatting functions.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Proper formatting enhances the readability of analytical results.  

## 5. **Additional Notes**  
- **Performance**: For large datasets, ensure the `reading_time` column is indexed.  
- **Edge Cases**: Handle `NULL` values in the `temperature` column if they exist.  

> [!WARNING]  
> `NULL` values in the `temperature` column will be excluded by `AVG()` by default.  

This solution efficiently transforms raw timestamp data into meaningful daily averages, which is a common requirement for monitoring and reporting systems.  

> [!TIP]  
> Practice this pattern with different time intervals (e.g., hourly, monthly) to strengthen your time series analysis skills.
