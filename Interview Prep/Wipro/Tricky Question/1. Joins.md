## 1. Explain the difference between **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN**.

### 1. INNER JOIN

> [!NOTE]
> **Only matching rows from both tables are included.**

- Returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
- If no match, the row is excluded from the result set.
- **Use case:** When you only need data that exists in both tables.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Student.NAME, StudentCourse.COURSE_ID
FROM Student
INNER JOIN StudentCourse
ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO;
```
- Only students enrolled in at least one course appear in the result.

### 2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

> [!NOTE]
> **All rows from the left table are included, with matching rows from the right table. If no match, NULLs are returned for right table columns.**

- Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.
- If no match, the result set will contain NULL for right table columns.
- **Use case:** When you want all records from the left table, regardless of matches in the right table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Student.NAME, StudentCourse.COURSE_ID
FROM Student
LEFT JOIN StudentCourse
ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO;
```
- All students appear, even if they are not enrolled in any course.

### 3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

> [!NOTE]
> **All rows from the right table are included, with matching rows from the left table. If no match, NULLs are returned for left table columns.**

- Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.
- If no match, the result set will contain NULL for left table columns.
- **Use case:** When you want all records from the right table, regardless of matches in the left table.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Student.NAME, StudentCourse.COURSE_ID
FROM Student
RIGHT JOIN StudentCourse
ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO;
```
- All courses appear, even if no student is enrolled.

### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

> [!NOTE]
> **All rows from both tables are included, with NULLs where no match exists.**

- Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
- If no match, NULLs are filled in for missing sides.
- **Use case:** When you want all records from both tables, regardless of matches.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT Student.NAME, StudentCourse.COURSE_ID
FROM Student
FULL OUTER JOIN StudentCourse
ON Student.ROLL_NO = StudentCourse.ROLL_NO;
```
- All students and all courses appear, with NULLs where there is no match.


### Key Callouts

<ins>**Callout 1: INNER JOIN vs. OUTER JOINs**</ins>
- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows.
- OUTER JOINs (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL): Include unmatched rows from one or both tables.

<ins>**Callout 2: LEFT JOIN vs. RIGHT JOIN**</ins>
- LEFT JOIN: All rows from the left table, plus matches from the right.
- RIGHT JOIN: All rows from the right table, plus matches from the left.

<ins>**Callout 3: FULL OUTER JOIN**</ins>
- Combines results of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
- Includes all rows from both tables, with NULLs where no match exists.

<ins>**Callout 4: Practical Use**</ins>
- Use INNER JOIN for matching data only.
- Use LEFT/RIGHT JOIN to preserve all rows from one table.
- Use FULL OUTER JOIN to preserve all rows from both tables.

<ins>**Callout 5: NULL Handling**</ins>
- OUTER JOINs return NULL for columns where no match is found, making it easy to identify missing relationships.

**Visualization Tip:** Imagine two circles (tables) overlapping. INNER JOIN is the overlap; LEFT JOIN is the left circle plus overlap; RIGHT JOIN is the right circle plus overlap; FULL OUTER JOIN is both circles.
