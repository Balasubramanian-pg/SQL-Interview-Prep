## 11. Difference between **view**, **materialized view**, and **table**.

| Feature                | **Table**                          | **View**                          | **Materialized View**               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Stores data physically on disk.    | Virtual table defined by a query. | Pre-computed result set stored on disk. |
| **Storage**            | Persistent, occupies disk space.   | No storage, just a saved query.  | Persistent, occupies disk space.    |
| **Data Freshness**     | Always up-to-date.                 | Always up-to-date (query runs each time). | Requires refresh (manual or automatic). |
| **Performance**        | Fast for direct access.            | Slower (query executes each time). | Fast (pre-computed), but may be stale. |
| **Use Case**           | Store raw data.                    | Simplify complex queries.         | Speed up read-heavy, complex queries. |
| **Modification**       | Supports CRUD operations.          | Limited (only DML via underlying tables). | Limited (requires full/partial refresh). |
| **Overhead**           | High (storage, maintenance).       | Low (no storage).                 | Medium (storage + refresh overhead). |

### **Key Callouts**

<ins>**Callout 1: Table**</ins>
- **Physical storage**: Data is stored directly on disk.
- **Best for**: Storing raw, transactional data.

<ins>**Callout 2: View**</ins>
- **Virtual**: No storage; the query runs every time you access it.
- **Best for**: Simplifying complex queries, security (restrict column access), or logical data organization.

<ins>**Callout 3: Materialized View**</ins>
- **Pre-computed**: Stores the result of a query, so it’s faster to read but requires refreshes.
- **Best for**: Reporting, dashboards, or read-heavy operations where real-time data isn’t critical.

<ins>**Callout 4: Performance Trade-off**</ins>
- **View**: Always up-to-date but slower (query runs on-the-fly).
- **Materialized View**: Faster reads but may be stale until refreshed.

<ins>**Callout 5: When to Use Which?**</ins>
- Use a **table** for raw data.
- Use a **view** for dynamic, up-to-date query results.
- Use a **materialized view** for performance-critical, read-heavy scenarios where slight staleness is acceptable.

**Example:**
- **Table**: `employees` (stores all employee records).
- **View**: `active_employees` (shows only active employees via a query).
- **Materialized View**: `monthly_sales_summary` (pre-computed for fast reporting, refreshed nightly).
