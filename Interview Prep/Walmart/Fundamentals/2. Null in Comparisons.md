# 2. *How does `NULL` behave in comparisons?*
### (e.g., `NULL = NULL` vs `IS NULL`.)

### NULL Behavior in Comparisons

*   **The Nature of NULL**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> NULL represents an unknown, missing, or inapplicable value.
*   It is not the same as zero, empty string, or false.
*   NULL means "value is not known" or "does not exist."
*   This affects all comparison operations.

**Comparison Operations with NULL**

*   **Equality Comparisons (=)**
> [!CAUTION]
> NULL = NULL does NOT return TRUE.
*   `NULL = NULL` returns **UNKNOWN** (treated as FALSE).
*   `NULL = 5` returns **UNKNOWN**.
*   `NULL = 'text'` returns **UNKNOWN**.
*   Any comparison with NULL using `=` returns UNKNOWN.

*   **Inequality Comparisons (<>, !=)**
> [!NOTE]
> NULL <> NULL does NOT return TRUE either.
*   `NULL <> NULL` returns **UNKNOWN**.
*   `NULL <> 5` returns **UNKNOWN**.
*   Any comparison with NULL using `<>` or `!=` returns UNKNOWN.

**Correct NULL Handling**

*   **IS NULL / IS NOT NULL**
> [!TIP]
> Always use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL for NULL checks.
*   `NULL IS NULL` returns **TRUE**.
*   `NULL IS NOT NULL` returns **FALSE**.
*   `5 IS NULL` returns **FALSE**.
*   `5 IS NOT NULL` returns **TRUE**.

**SQL Examples**

*   **Incorrect NULL Comparison**
```sql
-- This returns NO ROWS, even if there are NULL values
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE ManagerID = NULL;

-- This also returns NO ROWS
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE ManagerID <> NULL;
```

*   **Correct NULL Comparison**
```sql
-- Find employees with no manager
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE ManagerID IS NULL;

-- Find employees who have a manager
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL;
```

**NULL in WHERE Clause Behavior**

*   **Three-Valued Logic**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> SQL uses TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN logic with NULLs.
*   WHERE clause only returns rows where condition evaluates to TRUE.
*   UNKNOWN and FALSE conditions exclude rows.
*   This is why `= NULL` filters out all rows.

*   **Practical Impact**
```sql
-- These employees will NOT appear in results:
-- WHERE Salary > 50000  (if Salary is NULL)
-- WHERE Department = 'IT'  (if Department is NULL)  
-- WHERE HireDate = NULL  (always UNKNOWN)
```

**NULL in Aggregate Functions**

*   **COUNT() Behavior**
> [!NOTE]
> COUNT(column) ignores NULLs, COUNT(*) counts all rows.
*   `COUNT(*)` - counts all rows including those with NULLs.
*   `COUNT(ManagerID)` - counts only non-NULL ManagerID values.
*   `COUNT(1)` - counts all rows (same as COUNT(*)).

*   **Other Aggregates**
*   `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()` all ignore NULL values.
*   They operate only on known, non-NULL values.

**NULL in Logical Operations**

*   **AND Operations**
*   `TRUE AND NULL` = UNKNOWN
*   `FALSE AND NULL` = FALSE
*   `NULL AND NULL` = UNKNOWN

*   **OR Operations**  
*   `TRUE OR NULL` = TRUE
*   `FALSE OR NULL` = UNKNOWN
*   `NULL OR NULL` = UNKNOWN

*   **NOT Operations**
*   `NOT NULL` = UNKNOWN

**Best Practices**

*   **Always Use IS NULL/IS NOT NULL**
> [!TIP]
> Never use `= NULL` or `<> NULL` in your queries.
*   Explicitly handle NULL cases in your logic.
*   Consider using `COALESCE()` or `ISNULL()` for default values.

*   **Data Design Considerations**
> [!CAUTION]
> Decide consciously which columns should allow NULLs.
*   Use NOT NULL constraints where values are required.
*   Document the meaning of NULL in each nullable column.
