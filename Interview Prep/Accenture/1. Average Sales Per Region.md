# Average Sales per Region Analysis

## Problem Statement
A retail company wants to analyze its sales performance across different regions to identify:
- Which regions have the highest average sales values
- Regional performance comparisons
- Potential underperforming regions that may need attention

The company stores sales data in a table with information about each transaction's ID, region, and amount. We need to calculate the average sales amount for each region to support strategic decision-making.

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    region VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
```

**Table Structure:**
- `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale (Primary Key)
- `region`: The geographical region where the sale occurred (e.g., 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West')
- `amount`: The monetary value of the sale in dollars

## Sample Data

| sale_id | region | amount |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1       | North  | 150.00 |
| 2       | South  | 200.00 |
| 3       | East   | 175.50 |
| 4       | West   | 300.00 |
| 5       | North  | 225.00 |
| 6       | South  | 180.00 |
| 7       | East   | 210.00 |
| 8       | West   | 275.00 |

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT 
    region, 
    AVG(amount) AS avg_sales
FROM 
    Sales
GROUP BY 
    region
ORDER BY 
    avg_sales DESC;
```

## Solution Explanation

1. **SELECT Clause**:
   - `region`: This selects the region column to display in the results
   - `AVG(amount) AS avg_sales`: Calculates the average of the amount column for each group and aliases it as 'avg_sales'

2. **FROM Clause**:
   - Specifies we're querying data from the `Sales` table

3. **GROUP BY Clause**:
   - Groups the data by the `region` column before applying the aggregate function
   - This means all rows with the same region value are treated as a single group

4. **ORDER BY Clause (added for better analysis)**:
   - Sorts the results by `avg_sales` in descending order to show highest-performing regions first

## Expected Results

Using the sample data, the query would return:

| region | avg_sales |
|--------|-----------|
| West   | 287.50    |
| North  | 187.50    |
| East   | 192.75    |
| South  | 190.00    |

## Key Insights

1. **Performance Ranking**:
   - The West region has the highest average sales ($287.50)
   - The North region comes next ($187.50)
   - East and South regions are close in performance ($192.75 and $190.00 respectively)

2. **Analysis Implications**:
   - The West region's performance is significantly better than others (50% higher than North)
   - All other regions have relatively similar averages
   - Management might investigate why West performs so well (better sales team? more affluent customers?)

3. **Business Applications**:
   - Resource allocation decisions (where to focus marketing efforts)
   - Sales target setting (higher targets for West, improvement plans for others)
   - Identifying best practices from top-performing regions

## Advanced Considerations

For more comprehensive analysis, you might want to:

1. Add count of sales per region:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       region, 
       AVG(amount) AS avg_sales,
       COUNT(*) AS sales_count
   FROM Sales
   GROUP BY region;
   ```

2. Filter for specific time periods (if date column exists):
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       region, 
       AVG(amount) AS avg_sales
   FROM Sales
   WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
   GROUP BY region;
   ```

3. Compare to previous period averages to identify trends:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       region, 
       AVG(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN amount END) AS avg_2022,
       AVG(CASE WHEN year = 2023 THEN amount END) AS avg_2023,
       (AVG(CASE WHEN year = 2023 THEN amount END) - 
       AVG(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN amount END) AS yoy_change
   FROM Sales
   GROUP BY region;
   ```
