Here's the complete `INSERT INTO` query to populate the `sales` table for testing missing weekly sales date detection, along with additional test cases:

```sql
-- Create sales table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales (
    product_id INT,
    sales_date DATE,
    sales_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Clear existing data (if any)
TRUNCATE TABLE sales;

-- Insert sample data with various gap scenarios:
-- 1. Regular weekly data (no gaps)
-- 2. Single missing week
-- 3. Multiple consecutive missing weeks
-- 4. Missing weeks at beginning/end of range
-- 5. Irregular gaps (non-weekly intervals)
INSERT INTO sales (product_id, sales_date, sales_amount) VALUES
-- July - Regular weekly pattern
(101, '2024-07-04', 500.00),  -- Thursday
(102, '2024-07-11', 600.00),
(103, '2024-07-18', 550.00),
(104, '2024-07-25', 700.00),

-- August - Missing weeks
(105, '2024-08-01', 800.00),  -- Present
-- Missing: 2024-08-08
(106, '2024-08-15', 900.00),   -- Present (2 weeks gap)
-- Missing: 2024-08-22, 2024-08-29
(107, '2024-09-05', 1000.00),  -- Present (3 weeks gap)

-- September - Irregular pattern
(108, '2024-09-12', 750.00),   -- 1 week after
(109, '2024-09-26', 850.00),   -- 2 weeks gap
(110, '2024-10-10', 950.00);   -- 2 weeks gap
```

To test the missing weekly dates solution:

```sql
-- Step 1: Get date range
WITH date_range AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(sales_date) AS min_date,
        MAX(sales_date) AS max_date
    FROM sales
),

-- Step 2: Generate all expected weekly dates
expected_weeks AS (
    SELECT 
        DATEADD(DAY, -DATEPART(WEEKDAY, min_date) + 1, min_date) AS week_start_date
    FROM date_range
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        DATEADD(WEEK, 1, week_start_date)
    FROM expected_weeks
    WHERE DATEADD(WEEK, 1, week_start_date) <= (SELECT max_date FROM date_range)
)

-- Step 3: Find missing weeks
SELECT 
    CONVERT(VARCHAR, week_start_date, 23) AS missing_week_date
FROM 
    expected_weeks
WHERE 
    week_start_date NOT IN (SELECT sales_date FROM sales)
    AND week_start_date >= (SELECT min_date FROM date_range)
    AND week_start_date <= (SELECT max_date FROM date_range)
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 1000);
```

Alternative solution using a numbers table approach (works in most SQL dialects):

```sql
WITH date_range AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(sales_date) AS min_date,
        MAX(sales_date) AS max_date,
        DATEDIFF(WEEK, MIN(sales_date), MAX(sales_date)) AS week_diff
    FROM sales
),

numbers AS (
    SELECT TOP (SELECT week_diff + 10 FROM date_range)  -- Buffer for safety
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) - 1 AS n
    FROM sys.objects a
    CROSS JOIN sys.objects b  -- Cross join to ensure enough rows
),

expected_weeks AS (
    SELECT 
        DATEADD(WEEK, n, min_date) AS week_date
    FROM 
        numbers
    CROSS JOIN 
        date_range
    WHERE 
        DATEADD(WEEK, n, min_date) <= max_date
)

SELECT 
    CONVERT(VARCHAR, week_date, 23) AS missing_week_date
FROM 
    expected_weeks
WHERE 
    week_date NOT IN (SELECT sales_date FROM sales)
ORDER BY 
    week_date;
```

Key features of this test data:
1. **Regular weekly pattern** (initial period with no gaps)
2. **Single missing week** (August 8)
3. **Multiple consecutive missing weeks** (August 22 and 29)
4. **Irregular gaps** (September with varying intervals)
5. **Edge cases** (dates not falling exactly on weekly boundaries)

The solution should:
- Correctly identify all missing weekly dates within the range
- Handle the minimum and maximum dates properly
- Work with irregular date intervals in the source data
- Be efficient even with large date ranges

The recursive CTE solution is elegant but may have recursion depth limits in some databases. The numbers table approach is more portable and often more performant for large ranges. Both solutions should produce the same results when working correctly.
