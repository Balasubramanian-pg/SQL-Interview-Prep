**Pattern**: Managing records that are logically deleted but physically retained.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Add status or deletion timestamp columns
2. Filter queries to exclude deleted records
3. Design special queries to access or restore deleted records

**Example**: "Find all active products and all products deleted in the last 30 days."

```SQL
-- Active products
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    price
FROM products
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Recently deleted products
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    price,
    deleted_at
FROM products
WHERE
    deleted_at IS NOT NULL AND
    deleted_at > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```
