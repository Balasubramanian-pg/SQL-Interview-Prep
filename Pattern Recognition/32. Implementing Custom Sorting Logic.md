**Pattern**: Sorting results with complex business rules.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Define business rule priorities
2. Translate rules into CASE expressions in ORDER BY
3. Apply multiple sorting levels as needed

**Example**: "Sort products by availability, then category priority, then price."

```SQL
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    in_stock,
    category,
    price
FROM products
ORDER BY
    CASE
        WHEN in_stock = true THEN 0
        ELSE 1
    END,
    CASE
        WHEN category = 'Electronics' THEN 1
        WHEN category = 'Clothing' THEN 2
        WHEN category = 'Home' THEN 3
        ELSE 4
    END,
    price ASC;
```
