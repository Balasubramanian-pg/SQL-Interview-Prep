**Pattern**: Generating sequences or series of data.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Define a base case (initial values)
2. Create a recursive rule to generate additional values
3. Set appropriate termination condition

**Example**: "Generate a date series for every day in the current year."

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    -- Base case: January 1st of current year
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) AS date

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: add one day until year end
    SELECT date + INTERVAL '1 day'
    FROM date_series
    WHERE date < DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) + INTERVAL '1 year' - INTERVAL '1 day'
)
SELECT date FROM date_series;
```
