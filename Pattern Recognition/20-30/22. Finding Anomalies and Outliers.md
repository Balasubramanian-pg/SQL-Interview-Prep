**Pattern**: Identifying values that deviate significantly from the norm.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Calculate central tendency (mean/median)
2. Calculate dispersion (standard deviation)
3. Define outlier threshold (e.g., Â±3 standard deviations)
4. Filter for values beyond threshold

**Example**: "Find orders with unusually high values (>3 standard deviations from mean)."

```SQL
WITH order_stats AS (
    SELECT
        AVG(amount) AS mean_amount,
        STDDEV(amount) AS stddev_amount
    FROM orders
)
SELECT
    order_id,
    amount
FROM orders, order_stats
WHERE amount > mean_amount + 3 * stddev_amount;
```
