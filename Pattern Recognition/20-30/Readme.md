# README: The Discipline of SQL Pattern Recognition (20–29)

This set of topics advances from foundational pattern recognition toward analytical structures that reflect broader systemic behavior. Each problem type demands the capacity to impose clarity on complexity, revealing how data behaves across time, categories, and interactions. The discipline developed here strengthens the ability to reason about change, variation, and the patterns through which systems maintain or lose stability.

### [20. Advanced Filtering with Window Functions](20.%20Advanced%20Filtering%20with%20Window%20Functions.md)

Advanced filtering uses window functions to isolate meaningful segments within large datasets. This pattern demonstrates how structured evaluation across partitions helps identify what is essential while setting aside what is extraneous.

### [21. Calculating Retention-Churn Rates](21.%20Calculating%20Retention-Churn%20Rates.md)

Retention and churn reflect the durability of relationships within a system. Measuring them accurately requires clarity about continuity, loss, and the forces that keep groups stable or allow them to fragment over time.

### [22. Finding Anomalies and Outliers](22.%20Finding%20Anomalies%20and%20Outliers.md)

Anomalies represent deviations from expected structure. Detecting them is an exercise in distinguishing natural variation from disruptive irregularity, ensuring that conclusions are not distorted by exceptional cases.

### [23. Implementing Business Logic with CASE Expressions](23.%20Implementing%20Business%20Logic%20with%20CASE%20Expressions.md)

CASE expressions serve as a formal method for encoding conditional rules. They transform implicit judgment into explicit structure, allowing systems to behave predictably under varied circumstances.

### [24. Recursive Data Generation](24.%20Recursive%20Data%20Generation.md)

Recursion reveals how complex patterns emerge from simple repeated steps. It teaches that structure is often built incrementally, each layer dependent on the integrity of the one before it.

### [25. Calculating Funnel Conversion Rates](25.%20Calculating%20Funnel%20Conversion%20Rates.md)

Funnel analysis clarifies movement through staged processes. It shows where individuals continue, where they withdraw, and what structural weaknesses prevent progression.

### [26. Calculating Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis](26.%20Calculating%20Recency,%20Frequency,%20Monetary%20%28RFM%29%20Analysis.md)

RFM analysis examines behavior through three essential lenses: timeliness, repetition, and value. It imposes order on customer data by highlighting patterns that signify engagement and importance.

### [27. Implementing Sessionization](27.%20Implementing%20Sessionization.md)

Sessionization identifies bounded periods of activity. It distinguishes one coherent episode from another, allowing behavioral patterns to emerge from what otherwise appears continuous and unstructured.

### [28. AB Testing Analysis](28.%20AB%20Testing%20Analysis.md)

A/B testing compares alternative paths to determine which produces more stable or beneficial outcomes. It reflects the disciplined pursuit of evidence over assumption, revealing structure in controlled variation.

### [29. Implementing Dynamic Cohort Analysis](29.%20Implementing%20Dynamic%20Cohort%20Analysis.md)

Dynamic cohorts trace groups over time, showing how they evolve under shared conditions. This pattern uncovers long-term trajectories and highlights how initial states shape later behavior.
