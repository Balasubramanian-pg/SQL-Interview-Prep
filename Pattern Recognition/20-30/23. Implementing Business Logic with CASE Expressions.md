**Pattern**: Applying conditional business rules within queries.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify all business conditions
2. Translate each condition to a CASE statement
3. Apply the CASE in SELECT or WHERE as needed

**Example**: "Categorize customers by spending tier with different discount rates."

```SQL
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_spent,
    CASE
        WHEN total_spent >= 10000 THEN 'Platinum'
        WHEN total_spent >= 5000 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN total_spent >= 1000 THEN 'Silver'
        ELSE 'Bronze'
    END AS tier,
    CASE
        WHEN total_spent >= 10000 THEN 0.15
        WHEN total_spent >= 5000 THEN 0.10
        WHEN total_spent >= 1000 THEN 0.05
        ELSE 0
    END AS discount_rate
FROM customer_spending;
```
