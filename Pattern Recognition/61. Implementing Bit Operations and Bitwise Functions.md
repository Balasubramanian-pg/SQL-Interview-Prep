**Pattern**: Using binary operations for efficient data processing.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Define bit field meanings
2. Apply bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
3. Extract specific bits through shifting and masking
4. Use for compact feature encoding/decoding

**Example**: "Query user permissions using bitmasks."

```SQL
-- Define permission bits:
-- 1 (0001): Read
-- 2 (0010): Write
-- 4 (0100): Update
-- 8 (1000): Delete

-- Check if user has specific permissions
SELECT
    user_id,
    user_name,
    permission_bits,
    permission_bits & 1 > 0 AS has_read,
    permission_bits & 2 > 0 AS has_write,
    permission_bits & 4 > 0 AS has_update,
    permission_bits & 8 > 0 AS has_delete,
    -- Check for specific permission combination (Read + Write)
    (permission_bits & 3) = 3 AS has_read_write,
    -- Users with full permissions
    permission_bits = 15 AS has_all_permissions
FROM users;

-- Grant a permission (add Write to existing permissions)
UPDATE users
SET permission_bits = permission_bits | 2
WHERE user_id = 12345;

-- Revoke a permission (remove Delete from existing permissions)
UPDATE users
SET permission_bits = permission_bits & ~8
WHERE user_id = 12345;
```
