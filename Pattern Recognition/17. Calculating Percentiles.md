**Pattern**: Finding values at specific distribution points.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Use database-specific percentile functions
2. Order data and calculate positions
3. Find values at calculated positions

**Example**: "Find the 90th percentile of response times."

```SQL
-- Using a percentile function (varies by database)
SELECT
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.9) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY response_time) AS percentile_90
FROM response_logs;

-- Or manual calculation
WITH ordered_times AS (
    SELECT
        response_time,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY response_time) AS row_num,
        COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM response_logs
)
SELECT response_time AS percentile_90
FROM ordered_times
WHERE row_num = CEILING(0.9 * total_count);
```
