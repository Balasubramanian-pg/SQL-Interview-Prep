**Pattern**: Managing time-based resource allocation.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Define time slot availability
2. Check for conflicting allocations
3. Implement business rules for scheduling
4. Handle recurring patterns

**Example**: "Find available meeting rooms during a specific time period."
