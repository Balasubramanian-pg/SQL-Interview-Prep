**Pattern**: Finding the most commonly occurring value.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Group by the value of interest
2. Count occurrences
3. Order by count and limit to top result

**Example**: "Find the most common product category purchased."

```SQL
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM purchases
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
