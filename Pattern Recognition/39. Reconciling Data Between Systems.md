**Pattern**: Finding discrepancies between related datasets.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Define primary keys or match criteria
2. Perform full outer join
3. Identify missing or mismatched records
4. Categorize discrepancies

**Example**: "Reconcile inventory counts between warehouse and accounting systems."

```SQL
SELECT
    COALESCE(w.product_id, a.product_id) AS product_id,
    w.quantity AS warehouse_quantity,
    a.quantity AS accounting_quantity,
    w.quantity - a.quantity AS discrepancy,
    CASE
        WHEN w.product_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing in Warehouse'
        WHEN a.product_id IS NULL THEN 'Missing in Accounting'
        WHEN w.quantity != a.quantity THEN 'Quantity Mismatch'
        ELSE 'Matched'
    END AS status
FROM warehouse_inventory w
FULL OUTER JOIN accounting_inventory a ON w.product_id = a.product_id
WHERE w.product_id IS NULL OR a.product_id IS NULL OR w.quantity != a.quantity;
```
