**Pattern**: Using SQL to solve graph-based problems.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Model nodes and edges in relational tables
2. Use recursive CTEs for traversal
3. Track visited nodes to avoid cycles
4. Implement specific graph algorithms

**Example**: "Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph."

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE path_search AS (
    -- Base case: starting node
    SELECT
        start_node AS node,
        0 AS distance,
        ARRAY[start_node] AS path
    FROM (SELECT 10 AS start_node, 25 AS end_node) params

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: explore neighboring nodes
    SELECT
        e.to_node,
        ps.distance + e.weight,
        ps.path || e.to_node
    FROM path_search ps
    JOIN edges e ON ps.node = e.from_node
    WHERE
        e.to_node <> ALL(ps.path) AND -- Avoid cycles
        ps.distance + e.weight <= (
            -- Pruning: don't explore paths longer than best found so far
            SELECT COALESCE(MIN(distance), FLOAT 'infinity')
            FROM path_search
            WHERE node = (SELECT end_node FROM (SELECT 25 AS end_node) p)
        )
),

shortest_paths AS (
    -- Find paths that reach the destination
    SELECT
        distance,
        path
    FROM path_search
    WHERE node = (SELECT end_node FROM (SELECT 25 AS end_node) p)
)

SELECT
    distance,
    path,
    array_length(path, 1) - 1 AS num_hops
FROM shortest_paths
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 1;
```
