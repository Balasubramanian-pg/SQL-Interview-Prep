**Pattern**: Identifying a specific ranked value.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Order values in ascending/descending order
2. Apply ROW_NUMBER() or DENSE_RANK()
3. Filter for the specific rank

**Example**: "Find the 3rd highest salary in the company."

```SQL
-- Using ROW_NUMBER (excludes ties)
SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 3;

-- Using DENSE_RANK (includes ties)
SELECT salary
FROM (
    SELECT
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE rnk = 3;
```
