**Pattern**: Combining or comparing multiple result sets.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Create individual queries for each set
2. Apply appropriate set operator
3. Handle column alignment and type compatibility

**Example**: "Find customers who purchased product A but not product B."

```SQL
-- Customers who bought product A
SELECT customer_id
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE oi.product_id = 'A'

EXCEPT

-- Customers who bought product B
SELECT customer_id
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE oi.product_id = 'B';
```
