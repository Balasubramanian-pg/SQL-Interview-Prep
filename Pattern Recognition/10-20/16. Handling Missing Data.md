**Pattern**: Managing NULL values and incomplete datasets.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify columns with potential NULL values
2. Apply COALESCE() or IFNULL() for replacements
3. Use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL for filtering
4. Consider NULL handling in aggregations

**Example**: "Calculate average order value, treating missing prices as zero."

```SQL
SELECT
    AVG(COALESCE(order_amount, 0)) AS avg_order_value
FROM orders;
```
