**Pattern**: Analyzing data across different time periods.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Extract relevant time component (day, month, quarter, year)
2. Group by extracted time component
3. Apply aggregation functions as needed

**Example**: "Calculate monthly sales totals for 2023."

```SQL
SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_total
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
