**Pattern**: Extracting and manipulating text within string fields.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify string patterns to manipulate
2. Apply appropriate string functions
3. Filter or aggregate based on extracted information

**Example**: "Extract domain names from customer email addresses."

```SQL
SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email) + 1) AS domain
FROM customers;
```
