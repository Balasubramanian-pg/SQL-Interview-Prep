### Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are perfect for procedural decomposition as they allow you to:

- Break down complex queries into named sub-queries
- Improve readability by giving meaningful names to each logical step
- Debug intermediate results independently

```SQL
WITH step1 AS (
    -- First logical step
),
step2 AS (
    -- Second logical step using step1
),
step3 AS (
    -- Third logical step using step2
)
-- Final query using step3
```

### Using Subqueries

Subqueries enable you to:

- Isolate and solve one part of the problem
- Use the result as input to the next part
- Create a clear hierarchy of operations

### Using Temporary Tables

For very complex problems, temporary tables can help:

- Store intermediate results with clear names
- Break a complex problem into multiple simpler queries
- Improve performance for large datasets

```SQL
-- Step 1: Create a temporary table for the first logical step
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE step1 AS (
    SELECT ...
);

-- Step 2: Build on the first step
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE step2 AS (
    SELECT ... FROM step1 ...
);

-- Final query using step2
SELECT ... FROM step2 ...;
```
