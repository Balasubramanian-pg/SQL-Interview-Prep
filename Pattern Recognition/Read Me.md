Here‚Äôs a structured breakdown of what to expect for **SQL queries in data analysis, user queries, testing, and low-medium complexity ETL logic**, tailored to your background (B.Com + MBA in Business Analytics) and job search context (3.5 years of experience, Power BI/Tally/Excel, C-suite reporting).

---

### **1. Data Analysis Queries**
**Purpose:** Extract insights, validate hypotheses, or answer ad-hoc business questions.
**Expectations:**
- **Aggregations & Grouping** (e.g., sales trends, customer segmentation).
- **Joins** (merging tables like `transactions` + `customer_demographics`).
- **Window Functions** (ranking, running totals, YoY growth).
- **CTEs/Subqueries** (breaking complex logic into readable steps).

#### **Example Queries**
```sql
-- 1. Monthly Revenue Growth (YoY)
WITH MonthlyRevenue AS (
    SELECT
        DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
        SUM(revenue) AS revenue,
        LAG(SUM(revenue), 12) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) AS prev_year_revenue
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    month,
    revenue,
    prev_year_revenue,
    (revenue - prev_year_revenue) / prev_year_revenue * 100 AS yoy_growth_pct
FROM MonthlyRevenue
ORDER BY month;

-- 2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by Cohort
SELECT
    customer_cohort,
    AVG(total_spend) AS avg_clv,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers
FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('year', MIN(order_date)) AS customer_cohort,
        SUM(amount) AS total_spend
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY 1, 2
)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

> **üîπ Why It Matters:**
> - Tests your ability to **translate business questions into SQL** (e.g., "Why did revenue drop in Q3?").
> - Expect **follow-ups** like:
>   - *"How would you handle missing data in the `order_date` column?"*
>   - *"Can you modify this to exclude refunded orders?"*

---

### **2. User Queries (Ad-Hoc Requests)**
**Purpose:** Quick, accurate responses to stakeholder asks (e.g., "Show me top 10 products by margin in Karnataka").
**Expectations:**
- **Filtering** (`WHERE`, `HAVING`).
- **Sorting/Limiting** (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`).
- **Conditional Logic** (`CASE WHEN`).
- **Performance Awareness** (avoiding `SELECT *` on large tables).

#### **Example Queries**
```sql
-- 1. Top 10 High-Margin Products in Karnataka
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    SUM(revenue - cost) AS gross_margin
FROM sales
WHERE state = 'Karnataka'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 2. Customer Churn Risk (Inactive for 90+ days)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date,
    CASE
        WHEN DATEDIFF(day, MAX(order_date), CURRENT_DATE) > 90 THEN 'High Risk'
        ELSE 'Active'
    END AS churn_status
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1;
```

> **üîπ Pro Tip:**
> - **Always clarify requirements** before writing:
>   - *"Should ‚Äòmargin‚Äô be absolute or percentage?"*
>   - *"Do we exclude cancelled orders?"*
> - Use **temp tables** for intermediate steps if the query is complex.

---

### **3. Testing Queries**
**Purpose:** Validate data quality, ETL outputs, or edge cases.
**Expectations:**
- **Data Validation** (e.g., check for duplicates, nulls, referential integrity).
- **Edge Cases** (e.g., "What if a customer has no orders?").
- **Assertions** (e.g., "Ensure all `order_ids` in `payments` exist in `orders`").

#### **Example Queries**
```sql
-- 1. Find Orphaned Records (Payments without Orders)
SELECT p.payment_id
FROM payments p
LEFT JOIN orders o ON p.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

-- 2. Test ETL: Verify Row Counts Post-Load
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table) AS source_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table) AS target_count,
    CASE
        WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table)
        THEN '‚úÖ Match'
        ELSE '‚ùå Mismatch'
    END AS status;

-- 3. Check for Negative Revenue (Data Anomaly)
SELECT order_id, revenue
FROM orders
WHERE revenue < 0;
```

> **üîπ Red Flags in Interviews:**
> - Not testing for **nulls** or **divide-by-zero** errors.
> - Assuming all joins are `INNER` (forgetting `LEFT/RIGHT` for completeness).

---

### **4. Low-Medium Complexity ETL Logic**
**Purpose:** Transform raw data into analysis-ready formats.
**Expectations:**
- **Cleaning** (handling nulls, standardizing formats).
- **Transformations** (pivoting, unpivoting, derived columns).
- **Incremental Loads** (updating only new/changed data).
- **Basic Scheduling** (e.g., "Run this daily at 2 AM").

#### **Example Queries**
```sql
-- 1. Standardize Customer Names (ETL Cleaning)
UPDATE customers
SET customer_name = TRIM(UPPER(customer_name))
WHERE customer_name LIKE '%  %' OR customer_name LIKE '%a%';  -- Fix whitespace/casing

-- 2. Pivot Sales by Product Category (For Power BI)
SELECT
    region,
    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Electronics' THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS electronics_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'Clothing' THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS clothing_revenue
FROM sales
GROUP BY 1;

-- 3. Incremental Load (Only New Orders)
INSERT INTO target_orders
SELECT * FROM source_orders
WHERE order_date > (SELECT MAX(order_date) FROM target_orders);
```

> **üîπ Common Pitfalls:**
> - **Performance:** Avoid `UPDATE` on large tables without indexes.
> - **Idempotency:** Ensure rerunning the ETL doesn‚Äôt duplicate data.
> - **Logging:** Always log errors (e.g., failed rows) for debugging.

### **7. How to Prepare**
1. **Practice Platforms:**
   - [LeetCode (SQL Problems)](https://leetcode.com/problemset/database/)
   - [StrataScratch](https://www.stratascratch.com/) (Real-world scenarios)
   - [HackerRank (SQL)](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql)

2. **Focus Areas for You:**
   - **Financial Data:** YoY growth, cohort analysis (aligns with your B.Com/MBA).
   - **ETL:** Mimic your Tally/Excel workflows in SQL (e.g., reconciling ledgers).
   - **Power BI Integration:** Write SQL for direct queries (e.g., parameterized reports).

3. **Behavioral + Technical:**
   - *"Tell me about a time you found a data error with SQL."*
   - *"How would you explain a complex query to a non-technical stakeholder?"*

---
### **8. Sample Interview Workflow**
1. **Clarify Requirements:**
   - *"What‚Äôs the expected output format?"*
   - *"Are there any known data quality issues?"*

2. **Write the Query:**
   - Start with a **CTE** for readability.
   - Use **comments** to explain steps.

3. **Test & Optimize:**
   - *"How would you test this query?"* ‚Üí **"I‚Äôd check row counts, sample outputs, and edge cases."**
   - *"Can this be optimized?"* ‚Üí **"Adding an index on `order_date` would speed up the GROUP BY."**

4. **Explain Your Thought Process:**
   - *"I used a window function here because we need to compare each row to its previous value."*

---
### **9. Your Advantage**
- **Domain Knowledge:** Your finance/taxation background is a **plus** for queries involving:
  - **Reconciliations** (e.g., matching invoices to payments).
  - **Time-Based Aggregations** (fiscal years in Tally ‚Üí `DATE_TRUNC` in SQL).
  - **Executive Reporting** (e.g., "Show me top 5 high-value customers with declining spend").

> **üí° Tailor Examples to Your Experience:**
> - *"In my current role, I used SQL to automate a monthly P&L report previously done in Excel, reducing errors by 30%."*

---
### **Next Steps**
1. **Mock Scenario:** Try this problem:
   > *"Write a query to identify customers whose average order value (AOV) dropped by >20% compared to their first 3 months."*
2. **Share Your Solution:** I can review it and suggest optimizations.
3. **Deep Dive:** Want to explore ETL tools like **dbt** or **Airflow**? Let me know!
