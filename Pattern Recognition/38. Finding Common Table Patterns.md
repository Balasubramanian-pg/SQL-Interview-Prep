**Pattern**: Identifying shared patterns across tables or schemas.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Query metadata (information_schema)
2. Define pattern recognition criteria
3. Group and analyze matching tables

**Example**: "Find all tables with similar column patterns."

```SQL
WITH table_columns AS (
    SELECT
        table_name,
        STRING_AGG(column_name, ',' ORDER BY ordinal_position) AS column_pattern
    FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    GROUP BY table_name
),

pattern_counts AS (
    SELECT
        column_pattern,
        COUNT(*) AS frequency,
        STRING_AGG(table_name, ', ') AS matching_tables
    FROM table_columns
    GROUP BY column_pattern
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)

SELECT
    column_pattern,
    frequency,
    matching_tables
FROM pattern_counts
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
```
