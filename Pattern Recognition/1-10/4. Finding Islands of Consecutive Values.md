**Pattern**: Grouping consecutive values as a single entity.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Assign group identifiers by detecting changes
2. Use ROW_NUMBER() and differences to identify islands
3. Group by the calculated island identifier

**Example**: "Find date ranges when a service was continuously online."

```SQL
WITH numbered AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        date_sub(date, INTERVAL ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY date) DAY) AS group_date
    FROM service_logs
    WHERE status = 'online'
)
SELECT
    MIN(date) AS start_date,
    MAX(date) AS end_date
FROM numbered
GROUP BY group_date;
```
