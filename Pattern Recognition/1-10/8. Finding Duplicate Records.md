**Pattern**: Identifying repeated entries in a dataset.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Group by all relevant columns
2. Count occurrences
3. Filter for counts > 1

**Example**: "Find customers with duplicate email addresses."

```SQL
SELECT
    email,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM customers
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
