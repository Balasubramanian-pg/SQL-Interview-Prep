**Pattern**: Converting column headers to row values.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify columns to convert to rows
2. Use UNION ALL to stack values
3. Create identifier columns for the original column names

**Example**: "Convert quarterly sales columns to rows with quarter column."

```SQL
 SELECT product, 'Q1' AS quarter, Q1 AS sales FROM quarterly_sales 
 UNION ALL
 SELECT product, 'Q2' AS quarter, Q2 AS sales FROM quarterly_sales
 UNION ALL
 SELECT product, 'Q3' AS quarter, Q3 AS sales FROM quarterly_sales
 UNION ALL
 SELECT product, 'Q4' AS quarter, Q4 AS sales FROM quarterly_sales;
```
