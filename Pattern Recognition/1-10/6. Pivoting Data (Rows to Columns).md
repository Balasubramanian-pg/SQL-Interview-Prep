**Pattern**: Transforming row values into column headers.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify values to become columns
2. Use CASE or PIVOT (syntax varies by SQL engine)
3. Group by remaining dimensions

**Example**: "Show sales totals by product with quarters as columns."

```SQL
SELECT
    product,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q1' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Q1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q2' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Q2,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q3' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Q3,
    SUM(CASE WHEN quarter = 'Q4' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS Q4
FROM sales
GROUP BY product;
```
