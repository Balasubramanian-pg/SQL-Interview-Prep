**Pattern**: Computing progressive accumulation over time.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Sort data chronologically
2. Apply SUM() as window function with appropriate frame
3. Select original columns and the running total

**Example**: "Calculate the running total of sales by date."

```SQL
SELECT
    date,
    amount,
    SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM sales;
```
