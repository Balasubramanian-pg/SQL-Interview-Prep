**Pattern**: Computing averages over sliding windows.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Order data chronologically
2. Apply AVG() with window function and frame
3. Select original data with calculated average

**Example**: "Calculate 7-day moving average of daily stock prices."

```SQL
SELECT
    date,
    price,
    AVG(price) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg
FROM stock_prices;
```
