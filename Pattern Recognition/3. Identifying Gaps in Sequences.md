**Pattern**: Finding missing values in sequential data.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Generate a complete sequence using recursive CTE
2. Join with actual data to identify gaps
3. Filter to records where actual data is missing

**Example**: "Find missing IDs in a sequence of customer IDs."

```SQL
WITH sequence AS (
    SELECT MIN(customer_id) AS id FROM customers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id + 1 FROM sequence WHERE id < (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM customers)
)
SELECT id AS missing_id
FROM sequence
LEFT JOIN customers ON sequence.id = customers.customer_id
WHERE customers.customer_id IS NULL;
```
