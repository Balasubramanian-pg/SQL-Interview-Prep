**Pattern**: Identifying and isolating seasonal patterns in time-based data.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Extract seasonal components (day of week, month, etc.)
2. Calculate averages by seasonal component
3. Compare actual values to seasonal averages
4. Identify outliers or trends

**Example**: "Analyze sales data for day-of-week and monthly seasonality."

```SQL
WITH daily_sales AS (
    SELECT
        sale_date,
        EXTRACT(DOW FROM sale_date) AS day_of_week,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        SUM(amount) AS daily_total
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY sale_date
),

day_of_week_avg AS (
    SELECT
        day_of_week,
        AVG(daily_total) AS avg_daily_total
    FROM daily_sales
    GROUP BY day_of_week
),

month_avg AS (
    SELECT
        month,
        AVG(daily_total) AS avg_monthly_daily_total
    FROM daily_sales
    GROUP BY month
)

SELECT
    ds.sale_date,
    ds.daily_total,
    dow.avg_daily_total AS typical_for_day_of_week,
    m.avg_monthly_daily_total AS typical_for_month,
    ds.daily_total / dow.avg_daily_total AS day_of_week_ratio,
    ds.daily_total / m.avg_monthly_daily_total AS month_ratio
FROM daily_sales ds
JOIN day_of_week_avg dow ON ds.day_of_week = dow.day_of_week
JOIN month_avg m ON ds.month = m.month
ORDER BY ds.sale_date;
