## **Pattern**: Tracking historical changes in dimension tables.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Identify SCD type (Type 1, 2, or 3)
2. Define strategy for handling changes
3. Track validity periods for historical records
4. Join with appropriate time constraints

**Example**: "Implement SCD Type 2 for customer address changes."

```SQL
-- Update existing record and create new one
INSERT INTO customer_dimensions (
    customer_id,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    postal_code,
    valid_from,
    valid_to,
    is_current
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    NEW.address,
    NEW.city,
    NEW.state,
    NEW.postal_code,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    NULL,
    true
FROM new_customer_data NEW;

-- Mark previous record as no longer current
UPDATE customer_dimensions
SET
    valid_to = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 second',
    is_current = false
WHERE
    customer_id = NEW.customer_id AND
    is_current = true;

-- Query to get customer details as of a specific date
SELECT
    customer_id,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    postal_code
FROM customer_dimensions
WHERE
    customer_id = 123 AND
    '2023-06-15' BETWEEN valid_from AND COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31');
```

Your provided SQL example correctly outlines the implementation of a **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2** pattern, a fundamental concept in data warehousing. Your decomposition strategy and SQL code are sound and follow established best practices.

### Analysis of Assumptions

The core assumption is that **historical data must be preserved** for analytical purposes. Instead of overwriting a customer's address (SCD Type 1), you're choosing to create a new record. This is vital for business analysis where understanding past states is crucial (e.g., "How many orders were shipped to New York in Q1, before the customer moved?").

Another assumption is that the **`customer_id` is a business key**, and the table's primary key is likely a surrogate key that uniquely identifies each version of the customer record. This is good practice as it allows for multiple rows for the same business entity.

Finally, your logic assumes that the `UPDATE` and `INSERT` statements are executed as part of a single, **atomic transaction** to prevent race conditions. If a new record is inserted and the old one isn't immediately marked as inactive, your data could be temporarily inconsistent.

### Counterpoints & Alternative Perspectives

While your approach is standard, it's not the only way to implement an SCD Type 2, and there are trade-offs to consider.

* **Complexity of ETL**: This approach requires careful handling in your Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. You need to check for changes for every incoming record, and if a change is detected, you must first update the old record and then insert the new one. This dual-step process can be more complex to manage than a simple `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement.
* **Performance on large tables**: As your `customer_dimensions` table grows, the `UPDATE` statement can become slow, especially if it's not well-indexed. The `valid_to` and `is_current` columns need to be part of an effective indexing strategy to ensure efficient lookups.
* **Alternative: `CASE` statements for `valid_to`**: Instead of a separate `is_current` boolean flag, you can rely solely on the `valid_to` column. A `NULL` value in `valid_to` can implicitly signify the current record. While your approach is more explicit and can sometimes simplify queries, it adds a redundant column.
    * **Your Query**: `COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31')` is a great way to handle this, showing that you've already considered the `NULL` value for the current record.

### Breaking Down the Code into Components

The code you provided can be broken down into two distinct logical parts: the **write strategy** and the **read strategy**.

#### **1. Write Strategy (The ETL Process)**

This part handles how new data is ingested and how changes are managed. It's a two-step process that should ideally be a single transaction.

* **New Record Insertion (`INSERT INTO ...`)**:
    * This is the first step when a change is detected. A new row is inserted for the customer with the updated information.
    * It's assigned the current timestamp as its `valid_from` date, and the `valid_to` is set to `NULL` to signify it as the most current record. The `is_current` flag is explicitly set to `true`.
* **Old Record Expiration (`UPDATE ...`)**:
    * Immediately after inserting the new record, the old record must be "expired."
    * The `UPDATE` statement finds the previous active record for that customer using the `customer_id` and the `is_current = true` flag.
    * It sets the `valid_to` timestamp to a value just before the new record's `valid_from` timestamp, effectively closing the validity window of the old record. The `is_current` flag is then set to `false`.

#### **2. Read Strategy (Querying Historical Data)**

This is where the power of the SCD Type 2 pattern becomes evident. The query allows you to select a specific version of a customer's record.

* **Temporal Query (`SELECT ... WHERE ...`)**:
    * This query retrieves the state of a customer's dimension at a specific point in time.
    * The key is the `BETWEEN valid_from AND COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31')` clause.
    * `COALESCE` is used to replace `NULL` values in `valid_to` with a distant future date (`'9999-12-31'`), ensuring the current record's validity period extends indefinitely.
    * This allows you to pass in any date and retrieve the correct, historically accurate record for that time.
