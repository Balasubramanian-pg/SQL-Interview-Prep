**Pattern**: Querying data as it existed at a specific point in time.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Include validity period columns (valid_from, valid_to)
2. Apply appropriate time constraints in queries
3. Handle different types of temporal relationships

**Example**: "Find the customer's address as it was on a specific date."

```SQL
SELECT
    customer_id,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    postal_code
FROM customer_addresses
WHERE
    customer_id = 12345 AND
    '2023-03-15' BETWEEN valid_from AND COALESCE(valid_to, '9999-12-31');
```
