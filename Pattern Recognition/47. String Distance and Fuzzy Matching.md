**Pattern**: Finding similar text with slight variations.

**Decomposition Strategy**:

1. Choose appropriate string similarity metric
2. Calculate similarity scores
3. Set threshold for matches
4. Rank potential matches

**Example**: "Find potential duplicate customer names."

```SQL
-- PostgreSQL fuzzy matching
SELECT
    a.customer_id AS id_a,
    b.customer_id AS id_b,
    a.customer_name AS name_a,
    b.customer_name AS name_b,
    LEVENSHTEIN(LOWER(a.customer_name), LOWER(b.customer_name)) AS edit_distance
FROM customers a
JOIN customers b ON
    a.customer_id < b.customer_id AND
    LEVENSHTEIN(LOWER(a.customer_name), LOWER(b.customer_name)) <= 3
ORDER BY edit_distance;

-- Cross-database approach
WITH customers_pairs AS (
    SELECT
        a.customer_id AS id_a,
        b.customer_id AS id_b,
        a.customer_name AS name_a,
        b.customer_name AS name_b
    FROM customers a
    CROSS JOIN customers b
    WHERE a.customer_id < b.customer_id
)
SELECT
    id_a,
    id_b,
    name_a,
    name_b,
    custom_similarity_function(name_a, name_b) AS similarity
FROM customers_pairs
WHERE custom_similarity_function(name_a, name_b) >= 0.8
ORDER BY similarity DESC;
