### Pattern 1: Aggregation with Multiple Conditions

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Filter the base data first
2. Create groups
3. Apply aggregations
4. Filter aggregated results

### Pattern 2: Ranking and Top-N Problems

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Calculate the metric to rank by
2. Apply window functions for ranking
3. Filter by rank

```SQL
WITH ranked_data AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...) AS rank
    FROM ...
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_data WHERE rank <= N;
```

### Pattern 3: Gaps and Islands Problems

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Identify start/end points
2. Group consecutive items
3. Aggregate within groups

### Pattern 4: Hierarchical Data (Manager-Employee)

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Start with a base case
2. Recursively build relationships
3. Aggregate the results

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE org_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case (top level)
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.*
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_hierarchy oh ON e.manager_id = oh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM org_hierarchy;
```

## Performance Considerations in Your Decomposition

As you decompose problems, consider:

1. **Join Order:** Join smaller tables first
2. **Early Filtering:** Apply WHERE clauses before joins when possible
3. **Indexing Awareness:** Know which columns should be indexed
4. **Avoid Expensive Operations:** Like DISTINCT and ORDER BY on large datasets

## Communication Tips for SQL Interviews

When explaining your decomposition approach:

1. Begin by restating the problem
2. Explain your thought process before coding
3. Verbalize each step as you build the query
4. Discuss alternatives you considered
5. Mention potential optimizations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overcomplicating:** Sometimes a simpler approach works better
2. **Ignoring Edge Cases:** Consider NULL values, empty sets, duplicates
3. **Premature Optimization:** Focus on correctness first, then optimize
4. **Not Testing Mental Models:** Trace through your logic with sample data

## Conclusion

Procedural decomposition is invaluable for SQL interviews because it:

- Shows your structured thinking approach
- Makes complex problems manageable
- Communicates your thought process clearly
- Allows for incremental verification
- Identifies optimization opportunities

By mastering procedural decomposition, you transform from simply knowing SQL syntax to being able to solve real-world data problems systematically, which is exactly what interviewers are looking for.
