## [60. String Aggregation and Array Handling](https://www.google.com/search?q=60.%2520String%2520Aggregation%2520and%2520Array%2520Handling.md)

This module explores techniques for consolidating multiple row values into a single field and managing complex data types. It covers essential functions like `STRING_AGG` or `LISTAGG` for reporting, alongside array manipulation methods for handling non-relational data structures within a SQL environment.

## [61. Implementing Bit Operations and Bitwise Functions](https://www.google.com/search?q=61.%2520Implementing%2520Bit%2520Operations%2520and%2520Bitwise%2520Functions.md)

This section delves into low-level data processing using binary logic. It explains how to implement bitwise `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR` operations to manage high-performance flags, permission masks, and storage-efficient status tracking within database schemas.

## [62. Advanced Regular Expression Processing](https://www.google.com/search?q=62.%2520Advanced%2520Regular%2520Expression%2520Processing.md)

Focusing on sophisticated text parsing, this guide covers the use of Regular Expressions (RegEx) to solve complex pattern-matching problems. It demonstrates how to validate, extract, and replace string data that follows specific structural rules, such as identifying anomalies in unstructured text.

## [63. Time Zone Handling](https://www.google.com/search?q=63.%2520Time%2520Zone%2520Handling.md)

This topic addresses the critical challenges of temporal data consistency in global applications. It provides strategies for normalizing timestamps to UTC, managing Daylight Saving Time transitions, and using the `AT TIME ZONE` clause to ensure accurate reporting across different geographical regions.

## [64. Fiscal Calendar Handling](https://www.google.com/search?q=64.%2520Fiscal%2520Calendar%2520Handling.md)

Since business cycles rarely align perfectly with the Gregorian calendar, this section focuses on logic for custom financial reporting. It outlines how to calculate fiscal years, quarters, and periods (such as 4-4-5 structures) to support corporate accounting requirements.

## [65. Concrete Example: Solving a Complex SQL Interview Question](https://www.google.com/search?q=65.%2520Concrete%2520Example-%2520Solving%2520a%2520Complex%2520SQL%2520Interview%2520Question.md)

This is a comprehensive case study that applies multiple advanced concepts to a single high-stakes problem. It breaks down the methodology for interpreting business requirements, structuring Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and optimizing the final output for performance and clarity.

## [66. Advanced Procedural Decomposition Techniques for SQL](https://www.google.com/search?q=66.%2520Advanced%2520Procedural%2520Decomposition%2520Techniques%2520for%2520SQL.md)

This module teaches architectural best practices for writing maintainable SQL. It emphasizes "decomposing" massive queries into logical, modular steps, allowing for easier debugging, better readability, and more efficient execution plans in complex data pipelines.

## [67. Common SQL Interview Question](https://www.google.com/search?q=67.%2520Common%2520SQL%2520Interview%2520Question.md)

A focused review of high-probability interview scenarios. This section synthesizes various patterns—such as ranking, cumulative sums, and data gaps—into a practical preparation guide that mirrors the technical assessments used by top-tier tech companies.
